2024-12-08 - v13.0

This is a major release of pgBadger that fixes issues reported by
users since last release and adds some new features:

  * Add two new option to be able to redefined inbound of query and session
    histogram.
       --histogram-query VAL   : use custom inbound for query times histogram.
                                 Default inbound in milliseconds:
                             0,1,5,10,25,50,100,500,1000,10000
       --histogram-session VAL : use custom inbound for session times histogram.
                                 Default inbound in milliseconds:
                             0,500,1000,30000,60000,600000,1800000,3600000,28800000
    Thanks to JosefMachytkaNetApp for the feature request.
  * Add support of auto_explain plan for csv and json log formats. Thanks
    to zxwsbg and to Alexander Rumyantsev for the report.
  * Add three LOG message that was not reported as events: unexpected EOF,
    incomplete startup packet and detected deadlock while waiting for. Thanks
    to dottle for the report.

Backward compatibility issues:

  - Change the way LOG level events reported in the Events reports are
    stored. Some of them was still reported and counted as errors instead
    as LOG level entries. The fix is to stored and report them as EVENTLOG
    to differentiate them from queries. This change introduce a backward
    compatibility break when pgbadger is used in incremental mode. You will
    just have the double behavior during the week of the upgrade.
    Thanks to Matti Linnanvuori for the report.

Bug fixes:

  - Fix non reported queries generating the most cancellation due to statement_timeout.
  - Update regression tests
  - Fix formatting of explain plan when extracted from csv log format.
  - Fix jsonlog missing autovacuum data reports:
    Average Autovacuum Duration, Tuples removed per table
    and vacuums by hour in autovacuum activity report.
    Thanks to Ales Zeleny for the patch.
  - Fix orphan line not associated to the time consuming bind queries.
    Thanks to Henrietta Dombrovskaya for the report.
    Fix use of uninitialized value in pattern match. Thanks to Junior Dias
    for the patch.
  - Apply option --csv-separator to raw export to CSV. Default separator
    is semicolon (;). Thanks to Henrietta Dombrovskaya for the feature
    request.
  - Raw csv output: do not add double quote to parameters and application
    name if they are empty.
  - Add double quotes when queries have a semi colon in raw csv output.
    Thanks to Henrietta Dombrovskaya for the report.

2020-03-11 - v11.2

This release of pgBadger fix several issues reported by users since
past six months. It also adds some new features:

  * Add support and autodetection of AWS redshift log format.
  * Add support to pgbouncer 1.11 new log format.
  * Handle zstd and lz4 compression format
  * Allow to fully separate statistics build and HTML report build in
    incremental mode without having to read a log file. For example
    it is possible to run pgbadger each hours as follow:
    
        pgbadger -I -O "/out-dir/data" --noreport /var/log/postgresql*.log
    
    It just creates the data binary files in "/out-dir/data" then
   for example you can make reports each night for the next day in
   a separate directory `/out-dir/reports`:
    
        pgbadger -I -l "/out-dir/data/LAST_PARSED" -H "/out-dir/reports" /out-dir/data/2020/02/19/*.bin
    
    This require to set the path to the last parsed information, the
    path where HTML reports will be written and the binary data file
    of the day.

There is also new command line options:

  * Add new command line option --explain-url used to override the url
    of the graphical explain tool. Default URL is:
    
        http://explain.depesz.com/?is_public=0&is_anon=0&plan=
    
    If you want to use a local install of PgExplain or an other tool.
    pgBadger will add the plan in text format escaped at the end of
    the URL.

  * Add new option --no-week to instruct pgbadger to not build weekly
    reports in incremental mode. Useful if it takes too much time and
    resources.

  * Add new command line option --command to be able to set a command
    that pgBadger will execute to retrieve log entries on stdin.
    pgBadger will open a pipe to the command and parse log entries
    generated by the command. For example:
    
      pgbadger -f stderr --command 'cat /var/log/postgresql.log'
    
    which is the same as executing pgbadger with the log file directly
    as argument. The interest of this option is obvious if you have to
    modify the log file on the fly or that log entries are extracted
    from a program or generated from a database. For example:
    
      pgbadger -f csv --command 'psql dbname -c "COPY jrn_log TO STDOUT (FORMAT CSV)"'
    
  * Add new command line option --noexplain to prevent pgBadger to
    parse and report explain plan written to log by auto_explain
    extension. This is useful if you have a PostgreSQL version < 9.0
    where pgBadger generate broken reports when there is explain plan
    in log.

Backward compatibility:

  - By default pgBadger will truncate queries up to 100000 characters.
    This arbitrary value and can be adjusted using option --maxlength.
    Previous behavior was to not truncate queries but this could
    lead in excessive resources usage. Limiting default size is safer
    and the size limit might allow no truncate in most cases. However
    queries will not be beautified if they exceed 25000 characters.

Here is the complete list of changes and acknowledgments:

  - Fix non working --exclude-client option. Thanks to John Walsh
    for the report.
  - Add regression test for RDS log parsing and --exclude-client.
  - Fix progress bar for pgbouncer log file. The "queries" label is
    changed in "stats" for pgbouncer log files.
  - Add command line option --explain-url used to override the url
    of the graphical explain tool. Thanks to Christophe Courtois for
    the feature request.
  - Add support to pgbouncer 1.11 new log format. Thanks to Dan
    Aksenov for the report.
  - Handle zstd and lz4 compression format. Thanks to Adrien Nayrat
    for the patch.
  - Add support and autodetection of AWS redshift log format. Thanks
    to Bhuvanesh for the reature request.
  - Update documentation about redshift log format.
  - Add new option --no-week to instruct pgbadger to not build weekly
    reports in incremental mode. Thanks to cleverKermit17 for the
    feature request.
  - Fix a pattern match on file path that breaks pgBadger on Windows.
  - Fix #554 about cyrillic and other encoded statement parameters
    that was not reported properly in the HTML report even with custom
    charset. The regression was introduced with a fix to the well
    known Perl error message "Wide character in print". The patch have
    been reverted and a new command line option: --wide-char is
    available to recover this behavior. Add this option to your
    pgbadger command if you have message "Wide character in print".
    Add a regression test with Cyrillic and french encoding. Thanks
    to 4815162342lost and yethee for the report.
  - Update documentation to inform that lc_messages = 'en_US.UTF-8'
    is valid too. Thanks to nodje for the report.
  - Update documentation about --maxlength which default truncate size
    is 100000 and no more default to no truncate. Thanks to nodje for
    the report.

    for the patch.
  - Fix parsing of rds log file format. Thanks to Kadaffy Talavera for
    the report.

  - Add new command line option --command to be able to set a command
    that pgBadger will execute to retrieve log entries on stdin.
    Thanks to Justin Pryzby for the feature request.
  - Add new command line option --noexplain to prevent pgBadger to
    parse and report explain plan written to log by auto_explain
    extension. This is useful if you have a PostgreSQL version < 9.0
    where pgBadger generate broken reports when there is explain plan
    in log. Thanks to Massimo Sala for the feature request.

2019-09-16 - v11.1

This release of pgBadger fix several issues reported by users since
three months. It also adds some new features and reports:

  - Add report of top N queries that consume the most time in the
    prepare or parse stage.
  - Add report of top N queries that consume the most time in the
    bind stage.
  - Add report of timing for prepare/bind/execute queries parts.
    Reported in a new "Duration" tab in Global Stats report. Example:
        Total query duration: 6m16s
        Prepare/parse total duration: 45s564ms
        Bind total duration: 4m46s
        Execute total duration: 44s71m
    This also fix previous report of "Total query duration" that was
    only reporting execute total duration.
  - Add support to RDS and CloudWatch log format, they are detected
    automatically. You can use -f rds if pgbadger is not able to
    auto-detect the log format.
  - Add new configuration option --month-report to be able to build
    monthly incremental reports.
  - Restore support to Windows operating system.

There's also some bugs fixes and features enhancements.

  - Add auto-generated Markdown documentation in README.md using tool
    pod2markdown. If the command is not present the file will just not
    be generated. Thanks to Derek Yang for the patch.
  - Translate action WITH into CTE, regression introduced in last release.
  - Fix support of Windows Operating System
  - Add support to RDS and CloudWatch log format, use -f rds if pgbadger is
    not able to auto-detect this log format. Thanks to peruuparkar for the
    feature request.
  - Fix option -f | --format that was not applied on all files get from the
    parameter list where log format auto-detection was failing, the format was
    taken from the fist file parsed. Thanks to Levente Birta for the report.
  - Update source documentation file to replace reference to pgBadger v7.x
    with v11. Thanks to Will Buckner for the patch.
  - Limit height display size of top queries to avoid taking the whole page
    with huge queries. Thanks to ilias ilisepe1 for the patch.
  - Fix overflow of queries and detail in Slowest individual queries.
  - Fix SSH URIs for files, directories and wildcards. Thanks to tbussmann for
    the patch.
  - Fix URI samples in documentation. Thanks to tbussmann for the patch.
  - Hide message of use of default out file when --rebuild is used.
  - Add extra newline to usage() output to not bread POD documentation at
    make time.
  - Reapply --exclude-client option description in documentation. Thanks to
    Christoph Berg for the report.

2019-06-25 - v11.0

This release of pgBadger adds some major new features and fixes some
issues reported by users since the last four months. New features:

  - Regroup cursor related query (DECLARE,CLOSE,FETCH,MOVE) into new
    query type CURSOR.
  - Add top bind queries that generate the more temporary files.
    Require log_connection and log_disconnection be activated.
  - Add --exclude-client command line option to be able to exclude log
    entries for the specified client ip. Can be used multiple time.
  - Allow to use time only in --begin and --end filters.
  - Add -H, --html-dir option to be able to set a different path where
    HTML report must be written in incremental mode. Binary files stay
    on directory defined with -O, --outdir option.
  - Add -E | --explode option to explode the main report into one
    report per database. Global information not related to a database
    are added to the postgres database report.
  - Add per database report to incremental mode. In this mode there
    will be a sub directory per database with dedicated incremental
    reports.
  - Add support to Heroku's PostgreSQL logplex format. Log can be
    parsed using:

      heroku logs -p postgres | pgbadger -f logplex -o heroku.html -

  - When a query is > 10Kb we first limit size of all constant string
    parameters to 30 characters and then the query is truncated to 10Kb.
    This prevent pgbadger to waste time/hang with very long queries
    when inserting bytea for example. The 10Kb limit can be controlled
    with the --maxlength command line parameter.
    The query is normalized or truncated to maxlength value only after
    this first attempt to limit size.

This new release breaks backward compatibility with old binary or JSON
files. This also mean that incremental mode will not be able to read
old binary file. If you want to update pgBadger and keep you old reports
take care to upgrade at start of a new week otherwise weekly report will
be broken. pgBadger will print a warning and just skip the old binary
file.

There's also some bugs fixes and features enhancements.

  - Add a warning about version and skip loading incompatible binary file.
  - Update code formatter to pgFormatter 4.0.
  - Fix pgbadger hang on Windows OS. Thanks to JMLessard for the report.
  - Update tools/pgbadger_tools script to be compatible with new binary
    file format in pgBadger v11.
  - Add top bind queries that generate the more temporary files. This
    collect is possible only if log_connection and log_disconnection
    are activated in postgresql.conf. Thanks to Ildefonso Camargo for
    the feature request.
  - Fix auto detection of timezone. Thanks to massimosala for the fix.
  - Remove some remaining graph when --nograph is used
  - Force use of .txt extension when --normalized-only is used.
  - Fix report of auto vacuum/analyze in logplex format. Thanks to
    Konrad zichul for the report.
  - Fix use of progress bar on Windows operating system. Thanks to
    JMLessard for the report.
  - Use a `$prefix_vars{'t_time'} to store the log time. Thanks to Luca
    Ferrari for the patch.
  - Update usage and documentation to remove perl command from pgbadger
    invocations. Thanks to Luca Ferrari for the patch.
  - Use begin and end with times without date. Thanks to Luca Ferrari
    for the patch.
  - Added some very minor spelling and grammar fixes to the readme file.
    Thanks to ofni yratilim for the patch.
  - Fix remote paths using SSH. Thanks to Luca Ferrari for the patch.
  - Update regression test to works with new structure introduced with
    the per database report feature.
  - Fix fractional seconds in all begin and end parameters. Thanks to
    Luca Ferrari for the patch.
  - Fix documentation URL. Thanks to Kara Mansel for the report.
  - Fix parsing of auto_explain.
    Add more information about -U option that can be used multiple time.
    Thanks to Douglas J Hunley for the report.
  - Lot of HTML / CSS report improvements. Thanks to Pierre Giraud for
    the patches.
  - Update resource file.
  - Add regression test for logplex format.
  - Add support to Heroku's PostgreSQL logplex format. You should be able
    to parse these logs as follow:
        heroku logs -p postgres | pgbadger -f logplex -o heroku.html -
    or if you have already saved the output to a file:
        pgbadger heroku.log
    The logplex format is auto-dectected like any other supported format.
    pgBadger understand the following default log_line_prefix:
        database = %d connection_source = %r sql_error_code = %e
    or simply:
        sql_error_code = %e
    Let me know if there's any other default log_line_prefix. The prefix
    can always be set using the -p | --prefix pgbadger option:
        pgbadger --p 'base = %d source = %r sql_state = %e' heroku.log
    for example.
    Thanks to Anthony Sosso for the feature request.
  - Fix pgbadger help on URI use.
  - Fix broken wildcard use in ssh URI introduced in previous patch.
    Thanks to Tobias Bussmann for the report.
  - Allow URI with space in path to log file. Thanks to Tobias Bussmann
    for the report.
  - Fix URI samples in documentation. Thanks to Tobias Bussmann for the
    patch.
  - Fix t/02_basics.t to don't fail if syslog test takes more than 10s.
    Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.

2019-02-14 - v10.3

This release of pgBadger is a maintenance release that fixes some
log format autodetection issues another pgBouncer log parsing issue
reported by users. There is also a new feature:

    The -o | --outfile option can now be used multiple time to dump
    output in several format in a single command. For example:
        pgbadger -o out.html -o out.json /log/pgsql-11.log
    will create two reports in html and json format saved in the
    two corresponding files.

There's also some bugs fixes and features enhancements.

  - Fix statistics reports when there a filter on database, user,
    client or application is requested. Some queries was not
    reported.
  - Fix autodetection of pg>=10 defauilt log line prefix.
  - Fix autodetection of log file with "non standard" log line prefix.
    If --prefix specify %t, %m, %n and %p or %c, set format to stderr.
    Thanks to Alex Danvy for the report.
  - Remove extra space at end of line.
  - Add minimal test to syslog parser.
  - Fix a call to autodetect_format().
  - Truncate statement when maxlength is used. Thanks to Thibaud
    Madelaine for the patch.
  - Add test for multiple output format.
  - The -o | --outfile option can now be used multiple time to dump
    output in several format in a single command. For example:
      pgbadger -o out.txt -o out.html -o - -x json /log/pgsql-11.log
    Here pgbadger will create two reports in text and html format
    saved in the two corresponding file. It will also output a json
    report on standard output. Thanks to Nikolay for the feature
    request.
  - Move detection of output format and setting of out filename into
    a dedicated function set_output_extension().
  - Fix another pgBouncer log parsing issue. Thanks to Douglas J.
    Hunley for the report.

2018-12-27 - v10.2

This release of pgBadger is a maintenance release that fixes issues
reported by users during last three months. There is also some new
features:

  * Add support to pgbouncer 1.8 Stats log format.
  * Auto adjust javascript graph timezone.

There is a new command line option:

  * Add --exclude-db option to compute report about everything except
    the specified database.
  * Add support to http or ftp remote PostgreSQL log file download.
    The log file is parsed during the download using curl command
    and never saved to disk. With ssh remote log parsing you can use
    uri as command line argument to specify the PostgreSQL log file.
    
            ssh://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log
            http://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log.gz
            ftp://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log
    
    with http and ftp protocol you need to specify the log file format
    at end of the uri:
    
            http://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log:stderr
    
    You can specify multiple uri for log files to be parsed. This is
    useful when you have pgbouncer log file on a remote host and
    PostgreSQL logs in the local host.

    With ssh protocol you can use wild card too like with remote
    mode, ex: ssh://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log*
    
    Old syntax to parse remote log file using -r option is still
    working but is obsolete and might be removed in future versions.


There's also some bugs fixes and features enhancements.

  - Adjust end of progress bar with files with estimate size (bz2
    compressed files and remote compressed files.
  - Update year in copyright.
  - Add information about URI notation to parse remote log files.
  - Force progress to reach 100% at end of parsing of compressed
    remote file.
  - Extract information about PL/pgSQL function call in queries of
    temporary file reports. The information is append to the details
    display block.
  - Fix progress bar with csv files.
  - Fix reading binary file as input file instead of log file.
  - Encode html output of queries into UTF8 to avoid message "Wide
    character in print". Thanks to Colin 't Hart for the report.
  - Add Checkpoints distance key/value for distance peak.
  - Fix pgbouncer parsing and request throughput reports. Thanks
    to Levente Birta for the report.
  - Fix use of csvlog instead of csv for input format.
  - Add support to pgbouncer 1.8 Stats log format. Thanks to Levente
    Birta for the report.
  - Add warning about parallel processing disabled with csvlog. Thanks
    to cstdenis for the report.
  - Add information in usage output about single process forcing with
    csvlog format in -j and -J options. Thanks to cstdenis for the
    report.
  - Fix unknown line format error for multi line log while incremental
    analysis over ssh. Thanks to Wooyoung Cho for the report.
  - Add -k (--insecure) option to curl command to be able to download
    logs from server using a self signed certificate.
  - Auto adjust javascript graph timezone. Thanks to Massimino Sala
    for the feature request.
  - Add support to HTTP logfile download by pgBadger, for example:
        /usr/bin/pgbadger http://www.mydom.com/postgresql-10.log
  - Will parse the file during download using curl command.
  - Fix documentation. Thanks to 0xflotus for the patch.
  - Reapply fix on missing replacement of bind parameters after some
    extra code cleaning. Thanks to Bernhard J. M. Grun for the report.
  - Add --exclude-db option to compute report about everything except
    the specified database. The option can be used multiple time.

2018-09-12 - v10.1

This release of pgBadger is a maintenance release that fixes reports
in incremental mode and multiprocess with -j option. Log parsing from
standard input was also broken. If you are using v10.0 please upgrade
now.

  - Add test on pgbouncer log parser.
  - Some little performances improvment.
  - Fix not a valid file descriptor at pgbadger line 12314.
  - Fix unwanted newline in progressbar at startup.
  - Remove circleci files from the project.
  - Remove dependency of bats and jq for the test suite, they are
    replaced with Test::Simple and JSON::XS.
  - Add more tests especially for incremental mode and input from
    stdin that was broken in release 10.0.
  - Sync pgbadger, pod, and README, and fix some syntax errors.
    Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.
  - Add documentation on how to install Perl module JSON::XS from
    apt and yum repositories.
  - Fix URI for CSS in incremental mode. Thanks to Floris van Nee
    for the report.

2018-09-09 - v10.0

This release of pgBadger is a major release that adds some new
features and fix all issues reported by users since last release.

  * Add support of pgbouncer syslog log file format.
  * Add support to all auto_explain format (text, xml, json and yaml).
  * Add support to %q placeholder in log_line_prefix.
  * Add jsonlog format of Michael Paquier extension, with -f jsonlog
    pgbadger will be able to parse the log.
  * Replace the SQL formatter/beautify with v3.0 of pgFormatter.

There is some new command line option:

  - Add --prettify-json command line option to prettify JSON output.
  - Add --log-timezone  +/-XX  command line option to set the number
    of hours from GMT of the timezone that must be used to adjust
    date/time read from log file before beeing parsed. Note that you
    might still need to adjust the graph timezone using -Z when the
    client has not the same timezone.
  - Add --include-time option to add the ability to choose times that
    you want to see, instead of excluding all the times you do not
    want to see (--exclude-time).

The pgBadger project and copyrights has been transfered from Dalibo
to the author and official maintainer of the project. Please update

Jean-paul argudo for their help to promote pgBadger.


  - Fix checkpoint distance and estimate not reported in incremental
    mode. Thanks to aleszeleny for the report.
  - Fix title of pgbouncer simultaneous session report. Thansks to
    Jehan Guillaume De Rorthais for the report.
  - Add support of pgbouncer syslog log file format. Thanks to djester
    for the feature request.
  - Fix error when a remote log is empty. Thanks to Parasit Hendersson
    for the report.
  - Fix test with binary format. Binary file must be generated as it
    is dependent of the plateform. Thanks to Michal Nowak for the
    report.
  - Fix case where an empty explain plan is generated.
  - Fix parsing of autodetected default format with a prefix in
    command line.
  - Remove dependency of git command in Makefile.PL.
  - Update documentation about options changes and remove of the
    [%l-1] part of the mandatory prefix.
  - Fix parsing of vacuum / analyze system usage for PostgreSQL 10.
    Thanks to Achilleas Mantzios for the patch.
  - Fix Temporary File Activity table.
  - Remove dependency to git during install.
  - Add --log-timezone  +/-XX  command line option to set the number
    of hours from GMT of the timezone that must be used to adjust
    date/time read from log file before beeing parsed. Using this
    option make more difficult log search with a date/time because the
    time will not be the same in the log. Note that you might still
    need to adjust the graph timezone using -Z when the client has not
    the same timezone. Thanks to xdexter for the feature request and
    Julien Tachoire for the patch.
  - Add support to auto_explain json output format. Thanks to dmius
    for the report.
  - Fix auto_explain parser and queries that was counted twice.
    Thanks to zam6ak for the report.
  - Fix checkpoint regex to match PostgreSQL 10 log messages. Thanks
    to Edmund Horner for the patch.
  - Update description of -f | --format option by adding information
    about jsonlog format.
  - Fix query normalisation to not duplicate with bind queries.
    Normalisation of values are now tranformed into a single ? and no
    more 0 for numbers, two single quote for string. Thanks to vadv
    for the report.
  - Fix log level count. Thanks to Jean-Christophe Arnu for the report
  - Make pgbadger more compliant with B::Lint bare sub name.
  - Made perlcritic happy.
  - Add --prettify-json command line option to prettify JSON output.
    Default output is all in single line.
  - Fix Events distribution report.
  - Fix bug with --prefix when log_line_prefix contain multiple %%.
    Thanks to svb007 for the report.
  - Add --log-timezone  +/-XX  command line option to set the number
    of hours from GMT of the timezone that must be used to adjust
    date/time read from log file before beeing parsed. Using this
    option make more difficult log search with a date/time because the
    time will not be the same in the log. Note that you might still
    need to adjust the graph timezone using -Z when the client has not
    the same timezone. Thanks to xdexter for the feature request.
  - Remove INDEXES from the keyword list and add BUFFERS to this list.
  - Fix normalization of query using cursors.
  - Remove Dockerfile and documentation about docker run. pgBadger
    comes as a single Perl script without any dependence and it can
    be used on any plateform. It is a non sens to use docker to run
    pgbadger, if you don't want to install anything, just copy the
    file pgbadger where you want and execute it.
  - Fix broken grid when no temp files activity. Thanks to Pierre
    Giraud for the patch

    Thanks to Julien Tachoire for the patch.
  - Consistently use app= in examples, and support appname=
    Some of the usage examples used appname= in the prefix, but the
    code didn't recognize that token. Use app= in all examples, and
    add appname= to the prefix parser. Thanks to Christoph Berg for
    the patch
  - Fix wrong long name for option -J that should be --Jobs intead
    of --job_per_file. Thanks to Chad Trabant for the report and
    Etienne Bersac for the patch.
  - Ignore blib files. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for the patch.
  - Add consistency tests. Thanks to damien clochard for the patch.
  - doc update : stderr is not a default for -f. Thanks to Christophe
    Courtois for the patch.
  - Always update pod and README. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for
    the patch.
  - Add some regression tests. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for the patch.
  - Add editorconfig configuration. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for the
    patch.
  - Drop vi temp files from gitignore. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for
    the patch.
  - Add --include-time option to add the ability to choose times that
    you want to see, instead of excluding all the times you do not
    want to see. This is handy when wanting to view only one or two
    days from a week's worth of logs (simplifies down from multiple
    --exlucde-time options to one --include-time). Thanks to Wesley
    Bowman for the patch.
  - Check pod syntax. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for the patch.
  - Add HACKING to document tests. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for the
    patch.
  - Drop obsolete --bar-graph option. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for
    the patch.

    10k lines. Let's drop this. Thanks to Etienne Bersac for the
    patch.
  - Fix use of uninitialized value in SQL formatting. Thanks to John
    Krugger for the report and Jean-paul Argudo for the report.

2017-07-27 - v9.2

    log files.
  - Report information about "LOG:  skipping analyze of ..." into
    events reports.

	- Redefine sessions duration histogram bound to be more accurate. Thanks
	  to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Add connection time histogram. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the
	  feature request.

	  to avoid garbage especially on errors that generate a huge report.
	- Do not return SUCCESS error code 0 when aborted or something fails.
	  Thanks to Bruno Almeida for the patch.

2014-10-07 version 6.2

This is a maintenance release to fix a regression in SQL traffic graphs and
fix some other minor issues.

The release also add a new option -D or --dns-resolv to map client ip addresses
to FQDN without having log_hostname enabled on the postgresql's configuration

	- Do not display queries in Slowest individual, Time consuming and
	  Normalized slowest queries reports when there is no duration in
	  log file. Display NO DATASET instead.
	- Fix min/max queries in SQL traffic that was based on duration instead
	  of query count.
	- Fix wrong unit to Synced files in Checkpoints files report. Thanks
	  to Levente Birta for the report.
	- Enable allow_loose_quotes in Text::CSV_XS call to fix CSV parsing
	  error when fields have quote inside an unquoted field. Thanks to
	  Josh Berkus for the report.
	- Add -D | --dns-resolv command line option to replace ip addresses
	  by their DNS name. Be warned that this can slow down pgBagder a lot.
	  Thanks to Jiri Hlinka for the feature request.

2014-09-25 version 6.1

This release fix some issues and adds some new features. It adds a new option
-B or --bar-graph to use bar instead of line in graphs. It will also keep tick
formatting when zooming.

The release also add a new program: pgbadger_tools to demonstrate how to
works with pgBadger binary files to build your own new feature. The first
tools 'explain-slowest' allow printing of top slowest queries as EXPLAIN
statements. There's also additional options to execute automatically the
statements with EXPLAIN ANALYZE and get the execution plan. See help of the
program for more information or the README file in the tools directory.

Some modifications will change certain behavior:

	- The -T | --title text value will now be displayed instead of the
	  pgBadger label right after the logo. It was previously displayed
	  on mouse over the pgBadger label.

Here is the full list of changes/fixes:

	- Change -T | --title position on pgBadger report. Title now override
	  the pgBadger label. Thanks to Julien Rouhauld for the patch.
	- Add --file-per-query and --format-query option to write each slowest
	  query in separate file named qryXXX.sql and perform minimal formating
	  of the queries. Thanks to Rodolphe Quiedeville for the patch.
	- Remove debug query from explain-slowest tool.
	- Fix surge in sessions number report when an exclusion or inclusion
	  option (dbname, user, appname, etc.) is used. Thanks to suyah for the
	  report.
	- Fix fatal error when remote log file is 0 size. Thanks to Julien
	  Rouhaud for the report.
	- Allow pgbadger_tools --explain-slowest to automatically execute the
	  EXPLAIN statements an report the plan. See pgbadger_tools --help for
	  more explanation.
	- Add --analyze option to replace EXPLAIN statements by EXPLAIN
	  (ANALYZE, VERBOSE, BUFFERS).
	- Move pgbadger_tools program and README.tools into the tools/
	  subdirectory with removing the extension. Add more comments and
	  explanations.
	- Fix case where die with interrupt signal is received when using -e
	  option. Thanks to Lloyd Albin for the report.
	- Add a new program pgbadger_tools to demonstrate how to deal with
	  pgBadger binary files to build your own new feature. The first one
	  'explain-slowest' allow printing of top slowest queries as EXPLAIN
	  statements.
	- Keep tick formatting when zooming. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the
	  patch.
	- Fix automatic detection of rsyslogd logs. Thanks to David Day for
	  the report.
	- Fix issue in calculating min/max/avg in "General Activity" report. It
	  was build on the sum of queries duration per minutes instead of each
	  duration. Thanks to Jayadevan M for the report.
	- The same issue remains with percentile that are build using the sum of
	  duration per minutes and doesn't represent the real queries duration.
	- This commit also include a modification in convert_time() method to
	  reports milliseconds.
	- Add -B or --bar-graph command line option to use bar instead of line
	  in graph. Thanks to Bart Dopheide for the suggestion.
	- Fix Checkpoint Wal files usage graph title.

2014-08-08 version 6.0

This new major release adds some new features like automatic cleanup of binary
files in incremental mode or maximum number of weeks for reports retention.
It improve the incremental mode with allowing the use of multiprocessing with
multiple log file.

It also adds report of query latency percentile on the general activity table
(percentiles are 90, 95, 99).

There's also a new output format: JSON. This format is good for sharing data
with other languages, which makes it easy to integrate pgBadger's result into
other monitoring tools.

You may want to expose your reports but not the data, using the --anonymize
option pgBadger will be able to anonymize all literal values in the queries.

Sometime select to copy a query from the report could be a pain. There's now
a click-to-select button in front of each query that allow you to just use
Ctrl+C to copy it on clipboard

The use of the new -X option also allow pgBadger to write out extra files to
the outdir when creating incremental reports. Those files are the CSS and
Javascript code normally repeated in each HTLM files.

Warning: the behavior of pgBadger in incremental mode has changed. It will now
always cleanup the output directory of all the obsolete binary file. If you were
using those files to build your own reports, you can prevent pgBadger to remove
them by using the --noclean option. Note that if you use the retention feature,
all those files in obsolete directories will be removed too.

Here is the complete list of changes.


	- Javascript improvement to use only one call of sql_select and
	  sql_format. Use jQuery selector instead of getElementById to
	  avoid js errors when not found. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the
	  patches.
	- Add -R | --retention command line option to set the maximum number of
	  week reports to preserve in the output directory for incremental mode.
	  Thanks to Kong Man for the feature request.
	- Session count is immediately decreased when a FATAL error is received
	  in the current session to prevent overcount of simultaneous session
	  number. Thanks to Josh Berkus for the report.
	- Fix issue in incremental mode when parsing is stopped after rotating
	  log and rotated log has new lines. The new file was not parsed at all.
	  Thanks to CZAirwolf for the report.
	- Fix revert to single thread when last_line_parsed exists. Thanks to
	  Bruno Almeida for the report.
	- Fix issue in handling SIGTERM/SIGINT that cause pgbadger to continue.
	- Add autoclean feature to pgbadger in incremental mode. pgbadger will
	  now removed automatically obsolete binary files unless you specify
	  --noclean at command line.
	- Add new command line option --anonymize to obscure all literals in
	  queries/errors to hide confidential data. Thanks to wmorancfi for the
	  feature request.
	- Fix single "SELECT;" as a query in a report. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the report.
	- Add a copy icon in front of each query in the report to select the
	  entire query. Thanks to Josh Berkus for the feature request.
	- Fix wrong move to beginning of a file if the file was modified after
	  have been parsed a time. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Allow pgBadger to write out extra files to outdir when creating
	  incremental reports. Require the use of the -X or --extra-files option
	  in incremental mode. Thanks to Matthew Musgrove for the feature request.
	- Fix incomplete handling of XZ compressed format.
	- Fix move to offset in incremental mode with multiprocess and incomplete
	  condition when file is smaller than the last offset. Thanks to Herve
	  Werner for the report.

	- Add execute attribute to pgbadger in the source repository, some may
	  find this more helpful when pgbadger is not installed and executed
	  directly from this repository.
	- Fix issue with csv log format and incremental mode. Thanks to Suya for
	  the report and the help to solve the issue. There also a fix to support
	  autovacuum statistic with csv format.
	- Fix bad URL to documentation. Thanks to Rodolphe Quiedeville for the report.
	- Two minor change to made easier to use Tsung scenario: Remove the first
	  empty line and replace probability by weight. Now it is possible to use

2014-02-05 version 5.0

This new major release adds some new features like incremental mode and SQL
queries times histogram. There is also a hourly graphic representation of the
count and average duration of top normalized queries. Same for errors or events,
you will be able to see graphically at which hours they are occurring the most
often.

The incremental mode is an old request issued at PgCon Ottawa 2012 that concern
the ability to construct incremental reports with successive runs of pgBadger.
It is now possible to run pgbadger each days or even more, each hours, and have
cumulative reports per day and per week. A top index page allow you to go
directly to the weekly and daily reports.

This mode have been build with simplicity in mind so running pgbadger by cron
as follow:

	0 23 * * * pgbadger -q -I -O /var/www/pgbadger/ /var/log/postgresql.log

is enough to have daily and weekly reports viewable using your browser.

You can take a look at a sample report at http://dalibo.github.io/pgbadger/demov5/index.html

There's also a useful improvement to allow pgBadger to seek directly to the
last position in the same log file after a successive execution. This feature
is only available using the incremental mode or the -l option and parsing a
single log file. Let's say you have a weekly rotated log file and want to run
pgBadger each days. With 2GB of log per day, pgbadger was spending 5 minutes
per block of 2 GB to reach the last position in the log, so at the end of the
week this feature will save you 35 minutes. Now pgBadger will start parsing
new log entries immediately. This feature is compatible with the multiprocess
mode using -j option (n processes for one log file).

Histogram of query times is a new report in top queries slide that shows the
query times distribution during the analyzed period. For example:

	Range 		Count 		Percentage
	--------------------------------------------
	0-1ms		10,367,313	53.52%
	1-5ms		799,883		4.13%
	5-10ms		451,646		2.33%
	10-25ms		2,965,883	15.31%
	25-50ms		4,510,258	23.28%
	50-100ms	180,975		0.93%
	100-500ms	87,613		0.45%
	500-1000ms	5,856		0.03%
	1000-10000ms	2,697		0.01%
	> 10000ms	74		0.00%


There is also some graphic and report improvements, like the mouse tracker
formatting that have been reviewed. It now shows a vertical crosshair and
all dataset values at a time when mouse pointer moves over series. Automatic
queries formatting has also been changed, it is now done on double click
event as simple click was painful when you want to copy some part of the
queries.

The report "Simultaneous Connections" has been relabeled into "Established
Connections", it is less confusing as many people think that this is the number
of simultaneous sessions, which is not the case. It only count the number of
connections established at same time.

Autovacuum reports now associate database name to the autovacuum and autoanalyze
entries. Statistics now refer to "dbname.schema.table", previous versions was only
showing the pair "schema.table".

This release also adds Session peak information and a report about Simultaneous
sessions. Parameters log_connections and log_disconnections must be enabled in
postgresql.conf.

Complete ChangeLog:

	- Fix size of SQL queries columns to prevent exceeding screen width.
	- Add new histogram reports on top normalized queries and top errors
	  or event. It shows at what hours and in which quantity the queries
	  or errors appears.
	- Add seeking to last parser position in log file in incremental mode.
	  This prevent parsing all the file to find the last line parse from
	  previous run.  This only works when parsing a single flat file, -j
	  option is permitted. Thanks to ioguix for the kick.
	- Rewrite reloading of last log time from binary files.
	- Fix missing statistics of last parsed queries in incremental mode.
	- Fix bug in incremental mode that prevent reindexing a previous day.

	  frequent queries (N).
	- Add vertical crosshair on graph.
	- Fix case where queries and events was not updated when using -b and
	  -e command line. Thanks to Nicolas Thauvin for the report.
	- Fix week sorting on incremental report main index page. Thanks to
	  Martin Prochazka for the report.
	- Add "Histogram of query times" report to show statistics like
	  0-100ms : 80%, 100-500ms :14%, 500-1000ms : 3%, > 1000ms : 1%.
	  Thanks to tmihail for the feature request.
	- Format mouse tracker on graphs to show all dataset value at a time.
	- Add control of -o vs -O option with incremental mode to prevent
	  wrong use.
	- Change log level of missing LAST_PARSED.tmp file to WARNING and

	- Fix warning on META_MERGE for ExtUtils::MakeMaker < 6.46. Thanks
	  to Julien Rouhaud for the patch.
	- Add documentation about automatic incremental mode.
	- Add incremental mode to pgBadger. This mode will build a report
	  per day and a cumulative report per week. It also create an index
	  interface to easiest access to the different report. Must be run,
	  for example, as:
		pgbadger /var/log/postgresql.log.1 -I -O /var/www/pgbadger/
	  after a daily PostgreSQL log file rotation.
	- Add -O | --outdir path to specify the directory where out file
	  must be saved.
	- Automatic queries formatting is now done on double click event,
	  simple click was painful when you want to copy some part of the
	  queries. Thanks to Guillaume Smet for the feature request.
	- Remove calls of binmode to force html file output to be utf8 as
	  there is some bad side effect. Thanks to akorotkov for the report.

	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.

2013-10-31 - Version 4.0

This major release is the "Say goodbye to the fouine" release. With a full
rewrite of the reports design, pgBadger has now turned the HTML reports into
a more intuitive user experience and professional look.

The report is now driven by a dynamic menu with the help of the embedded
Bootstrap library. Every main menu corresponds to a hidden slide that is
revealed when the menu or one of its submenus is activated. There's
also the embedded font Font Awesome webfont to beautify the report.

Every statistics report now includes a key value section that immediately
shows you some of the relevant information. Pie charts have also been
separated from their data tables using two tabs, one for the chart and the
other one for the data.

Tables reporting hourly statistics have been moved to a multiple tabs report
following the data. This is used with General (queries, connections, sessions),
Checkpoints (buffer, files, warnings), Temporary files and Vacuums activities.

There's some new useful information shown in the key value sections. Peak
information shows the number and datetime of the highest activity. Here is the
list of those reports:

	- Queries peak
	- Read queries peak
	- Write queries peak
	- Connections peak
	- Checkpoints peak
	- WAL files usage Peak
	- Checkpoints warnings peak
	- Temporary file size peak
	- Temporary file number peak

Reports about Checkpoints and Restartpoints have been merged into a single report.
These are almost one in the same event, except that restartpoints occur on a slave
cluster, so there was no need to distinguish between the two.

Recent PostgreSQL versions add additional information about checkpoints, the
number of synced files, the longest sync and the average of sync time per file.
pgBadger collects and shows this information in the Checkpoint Activity report.

There's also some new reports:

	- Prepared queries ratio (execute vs prepare)
	- Prepared over normal queries
	- Queries (select, insert, update, delete) per user/host/application
	- Pie charts for tables with the most tuples and pages removed during vacuum.

The vacuum report will now highlight the costly tables during a vacuum or
analyze of a database.

The errors are now highlighted by a different color following the level.
A LOG level will be green, HINT will be yellow, WARNING orange, ERROR red
and FATAL dark red.

Some changes in the binary format are not backward compatible and the option
--client has been removed as it has been superseded by --dbclient for a long time now.

If you are running a pg_dump or some batch process with very slow queries, your
report analysis will be hindered by those queries having unwanted prominence in the
report. Before this release it was a pain to exclude those queries from the
report. Now you can use the --exclude-time command line option to exclude all
traces matching the given time regexp from the report. For example, let's say
you have a pg_dump at 13:00 each day during half an hour, you can use pgbadger
as follows:

	pgbadger --exclude-time "2013-09-.* 13:.*" postgresql.log 

If you are also running a pg_dump at night, let's say 22:00, you can write it
as follows:

	pgbadger --exclude-time '2013-09-\d+ 13:[0-3]' --exclude-time '2013-09-\d+ 22:[0-3]' postgresql.log 

or more shortly:

	pgbadger --exclude-time '2013-09-\d+ (13|22):[0-3]' postgresql.log 

Exclude time always requires the iso notation yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, even if log
format is syslog. This is the same for all time-related options. Use this option
with care as it has a high cost on the parser performance.


2013-09-17 - version 3.6

Still an other version in 3.x branch to fix two major bugs in vacuum and checkpoint
graphs. Some other minors bugs has also been fixed.

	- Fix grammar in --quiet usage. Thanks to stephen-a-ingram for the report.
	- Fix reporting period to starts after the last --last-parsed value instead
	  of the first log line. Thanks to Keith Fiske for the report.
	- Add --csv-separator command line usage to documentation.
	- Fix CSV log parser and add --csv-separator command line option to allow
	  change of the default csv field separator, coma, in any other character.
	- Avoid "negative look behind not implemented" errors on perl 5.16/5.18.
	  Thanks to Marco Baringer for the patch.
	- Support timestamps for begin/end with fractional seconds (so it'll handle
	  postgresql's normal string representation of timestamps).
	- When using negative look behind set sub-regexp to -i (not case insensitive)
	  to avoid issues where some upper case letter sequence, like SS or ST.
	- Change shebang from /usr/bin/perl to /usr/bin/env perl so that user-local
	  (perlbrew) perls will get used.
	- Fix empty graph of autovacuum and autoanalyze.
	- Fix checkpoint graphs that was not displayed any more.


2013-07-11 - Version 3.5

Last release of the 3.x branch, this is a bug fix release that also adds some
pretty print of Y axis number on graphs and a new graph that groups queries
duration series that was shown as second Y axis on graphs, as well as a new
graph with number of temporary file that was also used as second Y axis.

	- Split temporary files report into two graphs (files size and number
	  of file) to no more used a second Y axis with flotr2 - mouse tracker
	  is not working as expected.
	- Duration series representing the second Y axis in queries graph have
	  been removed and are now drawn in a new "Average queries duration"
	  independant graph.
	- Add pretty print of numbers in Y axis and mouse tracker output with
	  PB, TB, GB, KB, B units, and seconds, microseconds. Number without
	  unit are shown with P, T, M, K suffix for easiest very long number
	  reading.
	- Remove Query type reports when log only contains duration.
	- Fix display of checkpoint hourly report with no entry.
	- Fix count in Query type report.
	- Fix minimal statistics output when nothing was load from log file.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix several bug in log line parser. Thanks to Den Untevskiy for the
	  report.
	- Fix bug in last parsed storage when log files was not provided in the
	  right order. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix orphan lines wrongly associated to previous queries instead of
	  temporary file and lock logged statement. Thanks to Den Untevskiy for
	  the report.
	- Fix number of different samples shown in events report.
	- Escape HTML tags on error messages examples. Thanks to Mael Rimbault
	  for the report.
	- Remove some temporary debug informations used with some LOG messages
	  reported as events.
	- Fix several issues with restartpoint and temporary files reports.
	  Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix issue when an absolute path was given to the incremental file.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Remove creation of incremental temp file $tmp_last_parsed when not
	  running in multiprocess mode. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.


2013-06-18 - Version 3.4

This release adds lot of graphic improvements and a better rendering with logs
over few hours. There's also some bug fixes especially on report of queries that
generate the most temporary files.

	- Update flotr2.min.js to latest github code.
	- Add mouse tracking over y2axis.
	- Add label/legend information to ticks displayed on mouseover graphs.
	- Fix documentation about log_statement and log_min_duration_statement.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix missing top queries for locks and temporary files in multiprocess
	  mode.
	- Cleanup code to remove storage of unused information about connection.
	- Divide the huge dump_as_html() method with one method per each report.
	- Checkpoints, restart points and temporary files are now drawn using a
	  period of 5 minutes per default instead of one hour. Thanks to Josh
	  Berkus for the feature request.
	- Change fixed increment of one hour to five minutes on queries graphs
	  "SELECT queries" and "Write queries". Remove graph "All queries" as,
	  with a five minutes increment, it duplicates the "Queries per second".
	  Thanks to Josh Berkus for the feature request.
	- Fix typos. Thanks to Arsen Stasic for the patch.
	- Add default HTML charset to utf-8 and a command line option --charset
	  to be able to change the default. Thanks to thomas hankeuhh for the
	  feature request.
	- Fix missing temporary files query reports in some conditions. Thanks
	  to Guillaume Lelarge and Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix some parsing issue with log generated by pg 7.4.
	- Update documentation about missing new reports introduced in previous
	  version 3.3.

Note that it should be the last release of the 3.x branch unless there's major
bug fixes, but next one will be a major release with a completely new design.


2013-05-01 - Version 3.3

This release adds four more useful reports about queries that generate locks and
temporary files. An other new report about restart point on slaves and several
bugs fix or cosmetic change. Support to parallel processing under Windows OS has
been removed.

	- Remove parallel processing under Windows platform, the use of waitpid

	  and "Queries that waited the most". Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the
	  patch.
	- Add two reports about temporary files: "Queries generating the most

	  could be exactly the same than in log_line_prefix. Thanks to Cal
	  Heldenbrand for the report.
	- Fix perl documentation header, thanks to Cyril Bouthors for the patch.

2013-04-07 - Version 3.2

This is mostly a bug fix release, it also adds escaping of HTML code inside

	  future if hang with long queries still happen. Thanks to John
	  Rouillard for the report.
	- Fix an other issue in replacing bind param when the bind value
	  is alone on a single line. Thanks to Kjeld Peters for the report.
	- Fix parsing of compressed files together with uncompressed files
	  using the the -j option. Uncompressed files are now processed using

This is a quick release to fix missing reports of most frequent errors and slowest
normalized queries in previous version published yesterday.

	- Fix empty report in watchlog mode (-w option).
	- Force immediat die on command line options error.
	- Fix missing report of most frequent events/errors report. Thanks to
	  Vincent Laborie for the report.
	- Fix missing report of slowest normalized queries.  Thanks to Vincent
	  Laborie for the report.
	- Fix display of last print of progress bar when quiet mode is enabled.

2013-02-20 - Version 3.0

This new major release adds parallel log processing by using as many cores as
wanted to parse log files, the performances gain is directly related to the
number of cores specified. There's also new reports about autovacuum/autoanalyze
informations and many bugs have been fixed.

	- Update documentation about log_duration, log_min_duration_statement
	  and log_statement.
	- Rewrite dirty code around log timestamp comparison to find timestamp
	  of the specified begin or ending date.
	- Remove distinction between logs with duration enabled from variables
	  log_min_duration_statement and log_duration. Commands line options
	  --enable-log_duration and --enable-log_min_duration have been removed.
	- Update documentation about parallel processing.
	- Remove usage of Storable::file_magic to autodetect binary format file,
	  it is not include in core perl 5.8. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Force multiprocess per file when files are compressed. Thanks to
	  Julien Rouhaud for the report.
	- Add progress bar logger for multiprocess by forking a dedicated
	  process and using pipe. Also fix some bugs in using binary format
	  that duplicate query/error samples per process.
	- chmod 755 pgbadger
	- Fix checkpoint reports when there is no checkpoint warnings.
	- Fix non report of hourly connections/checkpoint/autovacuum when not
	  query is found in log file. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the
	  report.
	- Add better handling of signals in multiprocess mode.
	- Add -J|--job_per_file command line option to force pgbadger to use
	  one process per file instead of using all to parse one file. Useful
	  to have better performances with lot of small log file.
	- Fix parsing of orphan lines with stderr logs and log_line_prefix
	  without session information into the prefix (%l).
	- Update documentation about -j | --jobs option.
	- Allow pgbadger to use several cores, aka multiprocessing. Add options
	  -j | --jobs option to specify the number of core to use.
	- Add autovacuum and autoanalyze infos to binary format.

	- Fix issue with Perl 5.16 that do not allow "ss" inside look-behind
	  assertions. Thanks to Cedric for the report.
	- New vacuum and analyze hourly reports and graphs. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the patch.

UPGRADE: if you are running pgbadger by cron take care if you were using one of
the following option: --enable-log_min_duration  and --enable-log_duration, they
have been removed and pgbadger will refuse to start.

2013-01-17 - Version 2.3

This release fixes several major issues especially with csvlog and a memory leak
with log parsing using a start date. There's also several improvement like new
reports of number of queries by database and application. Mouse over reported
queries will show database, user, remote client and application name where they
are executed.

A new binary input/output format have been introduced to allow saving or reading
precomputed statistics. This will allow incremental reports based on periodical
runs of pgbader. This is a work in progress fully available with next coming
major release.

Several SQL code beautifier improvement from pgFormatter have also been merged.

	- Clarify misleading statement about log_duration: log_duration may be
	  turned on depending on desired information. Only log_statement must
	  not be on. Thanks to Matt Romaine for the patch.
	- Fix --dbname and --dbuser not working with csvlog format. Thanks to
	  Luke Cyca for the report.
	- Fix issue in SQL formatting that prevent left back indentation when
	  major keywords were found. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for the report.
	- Display 3 decimals in time report so that ms can be seen. Thanks to
	  Adam Schroder for the request.
	- Force the parser to not insert a new line after the SET keyword when
	  the query begin with it. This is to preserve the single line with
	  queries like SET client_encoding TO "utf8";
	- Add better SQL formatting of update queries by adding a new line
	  after the SET keyword. Thanks to pilat66 for the report.
	- Update copyright and documentation.
	- Queries without application name are now stored under others
	  application name.
	- Add report of number of queries by application if %a is specified in
	  the log_line_prefix.
	- Add link menu to the request per database and limit the display of
	  this information when there is more than one database.
	- Add report of requests per database.
	- Add report of user,remote client and application name to all request
	  info.
	- Fix memory leak with option -b (--begin) and in incremental log
	  parsing mode.
	- Remove duration part from log format auto-detection. Thanks to
	  Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix a performance issue on prettifying SQL queries that makes pgBagder
	  several time slower that usual to generate the HTML output. Thanks to
	  Vincent Laborie for the report.
	- Add missing SQL::Beautify paternity.
	- Add 'binary' format as input/output format. The binary output format
	  allows to save log statistics in a non human readable file instead of
	  an HTML or text file. These binary files might then be used as regular
	  input files, combined or not, to produce a html or txt report. Thanks
	  to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Remove port from the session regex pattern to match all lines.
	- Fix the progress bar. It was trying to use gunzip to get real file
	  size for all formats (by default). Unbreak the bz2 format (that does
	  not report real size) and add support for zip format. Thanks to Euler
	  Taveira de Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Fix some typos and grammatical issues. Thanks to Euler Taveira de
	  Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Improve SQL code highlighting and keywords detection merging change
	  from pgFormatter project.
	- Add support to hostname or ip address in the client detection. Thanks
	  to stuntmunkee for the report.
	- pgbadger will now only reports execute statement of the extended
	  protocol (parse/bind/execute). Thanks to pierrestroh for the report.
	- Fix numerous typos as well as formatting and grammatical issues.
	  Thanks to Thom Brown for the patch.
	- Add backward compatibility to obsolete --client command line option.
	  If you were using the short option -c nothing is changed.
	- Fix issue with --dbclient and %h in log_line_prefix. Thanks to Julien
	  Rouhaud for the patch.
	- Fix multiline progress bar output.
	- Allow usage of a dash into database, user and application names when
	  prefix is used. Thanks to Vipul for the report.
	- Mouse over queries will now show in which database they are executed
	  in the overviews (Slowest queries, Most frequent queries, etc. ).
	  Thank to Dirk-Jan Bulsink for the feature request.
	- Fix missing keys on %cur_info hash. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Move opening file handle to log file into a dedicated function.
	  Thanks to Marc Cousin for the patch.
	- Replace Ctrl+M by printable \r. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the report.


2012-11-13 - Version 2.2

This release add some major features like tsung output, speed improvement with
csvlog, report of shut down events, new command line options to generate report
excluding some user(s), to build report based on select queries only, to specify
regex of the queries that must only be included in the report and to remove
comments from queries. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade.

	- Update PostgreSQL keywords list for 9.2
	- Fix number of queries in progress bar with tsung output.
	- Remove obsolete syslog-ng and temporary syslog-ll log format added to
	  fix some syslog autodetection issues. There is now just one syslog
	  format: syslog, differences between syslog formats are detected and
	  the log parser is adaptive.
	- Add comment about the check_incremental_position() method
	- Fix reports with empty graphs when log files were not in chronological
	  order.
	- Add report of current total of queries and events parsed in progress
	  bar. Thanks to Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Force pgBadger to use an require the XS version of Text::CSV instead
	  of the Pure Perl implementation. It is a good bit faster thanks to
	  David Fetter for the patch. Note that using csvlog is still a bit
	  slower than syslog or stderr log format.
	- Fix several issue with tsung output.
	- Add report of shut down events
	- Add debug information on command line used to pipe compressed log
	  file when -v is provide.
	- Add -U | --exclude-user command line option to generate report
	  excluded user. Thanks to Birta Levente for the feature request.
	- Allow some options to be specified multiple time or be written as a
	  coma separated list of value, here are these options: --dbname,
	  --dbuser, --dbclient, --dbappname, --exclude_user.
	- Add -S | --select-only option to build report only on select queries.
	- Add first support to tsung output, see usage. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the feature request.
	- Add --include-query and --include-file to specify regex of the queries
	  that must only be included in the report. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the feature request.
	- Fix auto detection of log_duration and log_min_duration_statement
	  format.
	- Fix parser issue with Windows logs without timezone information.
	  Thanks to Nicolas Thauvin for the report.
	- Fix bug in %r = remote host and port log line prefix detection.
	  Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski for the report.
	- Add -C | --nocomment option to remove comment like /* ... */ from
	  queries. Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski for the feature request.
	- Fix escaping of log_line_prefix. Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski
	  for the patch.
	- Fix wrong detection of update queries when a query has a object names
	  containing update and set. Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.

2012-10-10 - Version 2.1

This release add a major feature by allowing any custom log_line_prefix to be
used by pgBadger. With stderr output you at least need to log the timestamp (%t)
the pid (%p) and the session/line number (%l). Support to log_duration instead
of log_min_duration_statement to allow reports simply based on duration and
count report without query detail and report. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade
asap.

	- Add new --enable-log_min_duration option to force pgbadger to use lines
	  generated by the log_min_duration_statement even if the log_duration
	  format is autodetected. Useful if you use both but do not log all queries.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Add syslog-ng format to better handle syslog traces with notation like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. It is autodetected but can be forced in the -f option
	  with value set to: syslog-ng.
	- Add --enable-log_duration command line option to force pgbadger to only
	  use the log_duration trace even if log_min_duration_statement traces are
	  autodetected.
	- Fix display of empty hourly graph when no data were found.
	- Remove query type report when log_duration is enabled.
	- Fix a major bug in query with bind parameter. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the report.
	- Fix detection of compressed log files and allow automatic detection
	  and uncompress of .gz, .bz2 and .zip files.
	- Add gunzip -l command to find the real size of a gzip compressed file.
	- Fix log_duration only reports to not take care about query detail but
	  just count and duration.
	- Fix issue with compressed csvlog. Thanks to Philip Freeman for the
	  report.
	- Allow usage of log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to
	  just collect statistics about the number of queries and their time.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Fix issue on syslog format and autodetect with additional info like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. Thanks to kapsalar for the report.
	- Removed unrecognized log line generated by deadlock_timeout.
	- Add missing information about unsupported csv log input from stdin.
	  It must be read from a file. Thank to Philip Freeman for the report.
	- Fix issue #28: Illegal division by zero with log file without query
	  and txt output. Thanks to rlowe for the report.
	- Update documentation about the -N | --appname option.
	- Rename --name option into --appname. Thanks to Guillaume Lellarge for
	  the patch.
	- Fix min/max value in xasis that was always represented 2 days by
	  default. Thanks to Casey Allen Shobe for the report.
	- Fix major bug when running pgbadger with the -e option. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the report and the great help
	- Change project url to http://dalibo.github.com/pgbadger/. Thanks to
	  Damien Clochard for this new hosting.
	- Fix lot of issues in CSV parser and force locale to be C. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the reports.
	- Improve speed with custom log_line_prefix.
	- Merge pull request #26 from elementalvoid/helpdoc-fix
	- Fixed help text for --exclude-file. Old help text indicated that the
	  option name was --exclude_file which was incorrect.
	- Remove the obsolete --regex-user and --regex-db options that was used
	  to specify a search pattern in the log_line_prefix to find the user
	  and db name. This is replaced by the --prefix option.
	- Replace Time column report header by Hour.
	- Fix another issue in log_line_prefix parser with stderr format
	- Add a more complex example using log_line_prefix
	- Fix log_line_prefix issue when using timepstamp with millisecond.
	- Add support to use any custom log_line_prefix with new option -p or
	  --prefix. See README for an example.
	- Fix false autodetection of CSV format when log_statement is enable or
	  in possible other cases. This was resulting in error: "FATAL: cannot
	  use CSV". Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix display of empty graph of connections per seconds
	- Allow character : in log line prefix, it will no more break the log
	  parsing. Thanks to John Rouillard for the report.
	- Add report of configuration parameter changes into the errors report
	  and change errors report by events report to handle important messages
	  that are not errors.
	- Allow pgbadger to recognize " autovacuum launcher" messages.

2012-08-21 - version 2.0

This major version adds some changes not backward compatible with previous
versions. Options -p and -g are not more used as progress bar and graphs
generation are enabled by default now.

The obsolete -l option use to specify the log file to parse has been reused to
specify an incremental file. Outside these changes and some bug fix there's
also new features:

    * Using an incremental file with -l option allow to parse multiple time a
      single log file and to "seek" at the last line parsed during the previous
      run. Useful if you have a log rotation not sync with your pgbadger run.
      For exemple you can run somthing like this:

	pgbadger `find /var/log/postgresql/ -name "postgresql*" -mtime -7 -type f` \
	    -o report_`date +%F`.html -l /var/run/pgbadger/last_run.log

    * All queries diplayed in the HTML report are now clickable to display or
      hide a nice SQL query format. This is called SQL format beautifier.

    * CSV log parser have been entirely rewritten to handle csv with multiline.

Every one should upgrade.

	- Change license from BSD like to PostgreSQL license. Request from
	  Robert Treat.
	- Fix wrong pointer on Connections per host menu. Reported by Jean-Paul
	  Argudo.
	- Small fix for sql formatting adding scrollbars. Patch by Julien
	  Rouhaud.
	- Add SQL format beautifier on SQL queries. When you will click on a
	  query it will be beautified. Patch by Gilles Darold
	- The progress bar is now enabled by default, the -p option has been
	  removed.  Use -q | --quiet to disable it. Patch by Gilles Darold.
