2013-09-17 - version 3.6

Still an other version in 3.x branch to fix two major bugs in vacuum and checkpoint
graphs. Some other minors bugs has also been fixed.

	- Fix grammar in --quiet usage. Thanks to stephen-a-ingram for the report.
	- Fix reporting period to starts after the last --last-parsed value instead
	  of the first log line. Thanks to Keith Fiske for the report.
	- Add --csv-separator command line usage to documentation.
	- Fix CSV log parser and add --csv-separator command line option to allow
	  change of the default csv field separator, coma, in any other character.
	- Avoid "negative look behind not implemented" errors on perl 5.16/5.18.
	  Thanks to Marco Baringer for the patch.
	- Support timestamps for begin/end with fractional seconds (so it'll handle
	  postgresql's normal string representation of timestamps).
	- When using negative look behind set sub-regexp to -i (not case insensitive)
	  to avoid issues where some upper case letter sequence, like SS or ST.
	- Change shebang from /usr/bin/perl to /usr/bin/env perl so that user-local
	  (perlbrew) perls will get used.
	- Fix empty graph of autovacuum and autoanalyze.
	- Fix checkpoint graphs that was not displayed any more.


2013-07-11 - Version 3.5

Last release of the 3.x branch, this is a bug fix release that also adds some
pretty print of Y axis number on graphs and a new graph that groups queries
duration series that was shown as second Y axis on graphs, as well as a new
graph with number of temporary file that was also used as second Y axis.

	- Split temporary files report into two graphs (files size and number
	  of file) to no more used a second Y axis with flotr2 - mouse tracker
	  is not working as expected.
	- Duration series representing the second Y axis in queries graph have
	  been removed and are now drawn in a new "Average queries duration"
	  independant graph.
	- Add pretty print of numbers in Y axis and mouse tracker output with
	  PB, TB, GB, KB, B units, and seconds, microseconds. Number without
	  unit are shown with P, T, M, K suffix for easiest very long number
	  reading.
	- Remove Query type reports when log only contains duration.
	- Fix display of checkpoint hourly report with no entry.
	- Fix count in Query type report.
	- Fix minimal statistics output when nothing was load from log file.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix several bug in log line parser. Thanks to Den Untevskiy for the
	  report.
	- Fix bug in last parsed storage when log files was not provided in the
	  right order. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix orphan lines wrongly associated to previous queries instead of
	  temporary file and lock logged statement. Thanks to Den Untevskiy for
	  the report.
	- Fix number of different samples shown in events report.
	- Escape HTML tags on error messages examples. Thanks to Mael Rimbault
	  for the report.
	- Remove some temporary debug informations used with some LOG messages
	  reported as events.
	- Fix several issues with restartpoint and temporary files reports.
	  Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix issue when an absolute path was given to the incremental file.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Remove creation of incremental temp file $tmp_last_parsed when not
	  running in multiprocess mode. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.


2013-06-18 - Version 3.4

This release adds lot of graphic improvements and a better rendering with logs
over few hours. There's also some bug fixes especially on report of queries that
generate the most temporary files.

	- Update flotr2.min.js to latest github code.
	- Add mouse tracking over y2axis.
	- Add label/legend information to ticks displayed on mouseover graphs.
	- Fix documentation about log_statement and log_min_duration_statement.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix missing top queries for locks and temporary files in multiprocess
	  mode.
	- Cleanup code to remove storage of unused information about connection.
	- Divide the huge dump_as_html() method with one method per each report.
	- Checkpoints, restart points and temporary files are now drawn using a
	  period of 5 minutes per default instead of one hour. Thanks to Josh
	  Berkus for the feature request.
	- Change fixed increment of one hour to five minutes on queries graphs
	  "SELECT queries" and "Write queries". Remove graph "All queries" as,
	  with a five minutes increment, it duplicates the "Queries per second".
	  Thanks to Josh Berkus for the feature request.
	- Fix typos. Thanks to Arsen Stasic for the patch.
	- Add default HTML charset to utf-8 and a command line option --charset
	  to be able to change the default. Thanks to thomas hankeuhh for the
	  feature request.
	- Fix missing temporary files query reports in some conditions. Thanks
	  to Guillaume Lelarge and Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix some parsing issue with log generated by pg 7.4.
	- Update documentation about missing new reports introduced in previous
	  version 3.3.

Note that it should be the last release of the 3.x branch unless there's major
bug fixes, but next one will be a major release with a completely new design.


2013-05-01 - Version 3.3

This release adds four more useful reports about queries that generate locks and
temporary files. An other new report about restart point on slaves and several
bugs fix or cosmetic change. Support to parallel processing under Windows OS has
been removed.

	- Remove parallel processing under Windows platform, the use of waitpid

	  Heldenbrand for the report.
	- Fix perl documentation header, thanks to Cyril Bouthors for the patch.

2013-04-07 - Version 3.2

This is mostly a bug fix release, it also adds escaping of HTML code inside

	  Laborie for the report.
	- Fix display of last print of progress bar when quiet mode is enabled.

2013-02-20 - Version 3.0

This new major release adds parallel log processing by using as many cores as
wanted to parse log files, the performances gain is directly related to the
number of cores specified. There's also new reports about autovacuum/autoanalyze
informations and many bugs have been fixed.

	- Update documentation about log_duration, log_min_duration_statement
	  and log_statement.
	- Rewrite dirty code around log timestamp comparison to find timestamp
	  of the specified begin or ending date.
	- Remove distinction between logs with duration enabled from variables
	  log_min_duration_statement and log_duration. Commands line options
	  --enable-log_duration and --enable-log_min_duration have been removed.
	- Update documentation about parallel processing.
	- Remove usage of Storable::file_magic to autodetect binary format file,
	  it is not include in core perl 5.8. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Force multiprocess per file when files are compressed. Thanks to
	  Julien Rouhaud for the report.
	- Add progress bar logger for multiprocess by forking a dedicated
	  process and using pipe. Also fix some bugs in using binary format
	  that duplicate query/error samples per process.
	- chmod 755 pgbadger
	- Fix checkpoint reports when there is no checkpoint warnings.
	- Fix non report of hourly connections/checkpoint/autovacuum when not
	  query is found in log file. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the
	  report.
	- Add better handling of signals in multiprocess mode.
	- Add -J|--job_per_file command line option to force pgbadger to use
	  one process per file instead of using all to parse one file. Useful
	  to have better performances with lot of small log file.
	- Fix parsing of orphan lines with stderr logs and log_line_prefix
	  without session information into the prefix (%l).
	- Update documentation about -j | --jobs option.

	  assertions. Thanks to Cedric for the report.
	- New vacuum and analyze hourly reports and graphs. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the patch.

UPGRADE: if you are running pgbadger by cron take care if you were using one of
the following option: --enable-log_min_duration  and --enable-log_duration, they
have been removed and pgbadger will refuse to start.

2013-01-17 - Version 2.3

This release fixes several major issues especially with csvlog and a memory leak
with log parsing using a start date. There's also several improvement like new
reports of number of queries by database and application. Mouse over reported
queries will show database, user, remote client and application name where they
are executed.

A new binary input/output format have been introduced to allow saving or reading
precomputed statistics. This will allow incremental reports based on periodical
runs of pgbader. This is a work in progress fully available with next coming
major release.

Several SQL code beautifier improvement from pgFormatter have also been merged.

	- Clarify misleading statement about log_duration: log_duration may be
	  turned on depending on desired information. Only log_statement must
	  not be on. Thanks to Matt Romaine for the patch.
	- Fix --dbname and --dbuser not working with csvlog format. Thanks to
	  Luke Cyca for the report.
	- Fix issue in SQL formatting that prevent left back indentation when
	  major keywords were found. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for the report.
	- Display 3 decimals in time report so that ms can be seen. Thanks to
	  Adam Schroder for the request.
	- Force the parser to not insert a new line after the SET keyword when
	  the query begin with it. This is to preserve the single line with
	  queries like SET client_encoding TO "utf8";
	- Add better SQL formatting of update queries by adding a new line
	  after the SET keyword. Thanks to pilat66 for the report.
	- Update copyright and documentation.
	- Queries without application name are now stored under others
	  application name.
	- Add report of number of queries by application if %a is specified in
	  the log_line_prefix.

	  this information when there is more than one database.
	- Add report of requests per database.
	- Add report of user,remote client and application name to all request
	  info.
	- Fix memory leak with option -b (--begin) and in incremental log
	  parsing mode.
	- Remove duration part from log format auto-detection. Thanks to
	  Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix a performance issue on prettifying SQL queries that makes pgBagder
	  several time slower that usual to generate the HTML output. Thanks to
	  Vincent Laborie for the report.
	- Add missing SQL::Beautify paternity.
	- Add 'binary' format as input/output format. The binary output format
	  allows to save log statistics in a non human readable file instead of
	  an HTML or text file. These binary files might then be used as regular
	  input files, combined or not, to produce a html or txt report. Thanks
	  to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Remove port from the session regex pattern to match all lines.
	- Fix the progress bar. It was trying to use gunzip to get real file
	  size for all formats (by default). Unbreak the bz2 format (that does
	  not report real size) and add support for zip format. Thanks to Euler
	  Taveira de Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Fix some typos and grammatical issues. Thanks to Euler Taveira de
	  Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Improve SQL code highlighting and keywords detection merging change
	  from pgFormatter project.
	- Add support to hostname or ip address in the client detection. Thanks
	  to stuntmunkee for the report.

	  in the overviews (Slowest queries, Most frequent queries, etc. ).
	  Thank to Dirk-Jan Bulsink for the feature request.
	- Fix missing keys on %cur_info hash. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Move opening file handle to log file into a dedicated function.
	  Thanks to Marc Cousin for the patch.
	- Replace Ctrl+M by printable \r. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the report.


2012-11-13 - Version 2.2

This release add some major features like tsung output, speed improvement with
csvlog, report of shut down events, new command line options to generate report
excluding some user(s), to build report based on select queries only, to specify
regex of the queries that must only be included in the report and to remove
comments from queries. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade.

	- Update PostgreSQL keywords list for 9.2
	- Fix number of queries in progress bar with tsung output.
	- Remove obsolete syslog-ng and temporary syslog-ll log format added to
	  fix some syslog autodetection issues. There is now just one syslog
	  format: syslog, differences between syslog formats are detected and
	  the log parser is adaptive.
	- Add comment about the check_incremental_position() method
	- Fix reports with empty graphs when log files were not in chronological
	  order.
	- Add report of current total of queries and events parsed in progress
	  bar. Thanks to Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Force pgBadger to use an require the XS version of Text::CSV instead
	  of the Pure Perl implementation. It is a good bit faster thanks to
	  David Fetter for the patch. Note that using csvlog is still a bit
	  slower than syslog or stderr log format.
	- Fix several issue with tsung output.
	- Add report of shut down events
	- Add debug information on command line used to pipe compressed log
	  file when -v is provide.
	- Add -U | --exclude-user command line option to generate report
	  excluded user. Thanks to Birta Levente for the feature request.
	- Allow some options to be specified multiple time or be written as a
	  coma separated list of value, here are these options: --dbname,
	  --dbuser, --dbclient, --dbappname, --exclude_user.
	- Add -S | --select-only option to build report only on select queries.
	- Add first support to tsung output, see usage. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the feature request.

	  that must only be included in the report. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the feature request.
	- Fix auto detection of log_duration and log_min_duration_statement
	  format.
	- Fix parser issue with Windows logs without timezone information.

	  containing update and set. Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.

2012-10-10 - Version 2.1

This release add a major feature by allowing any custom log_line_prefix to be
used by pgBadger. With stderr output you at least need to log the timestamp (%t)
the pid (%p) and the session/line number (%l). Support to log_duration instead
of log_min_duration_statement to allow reports simply based on duration and
count report without query detail and report. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade
asap.

	- Add new --enable-log_min_duration option to force pgbadger to use lines
	  generated by the log_min_duration_statement even if the log_duration
	  format is autodetected. Useful if you use both but do not log all queries.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Add syslog-ng format to better handle syslog traces with notation like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. It is autodetected but can be forced in the -f option
	  with value set to: syslog-ng.
	- Add --enable-log_duration command line option to force pgbadger to only
	  use the log_duration trace even if log_min_duration_statement traces are
	  autodetected.
	- Fix display of empty hourly graph when no data were found.
	- Remove query type report when log_duration is enabled.
	- Fix a major bug in query with bind parameter. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the report.
	- Fix detection of compressed log files and allow automatic detection
	  and uncompress of .gz, .bz2 and .zip files.
	- Add gunzip -l command to find the real size of a gzip compressed file.
	- Fix log_duration only reports to not take care about query detail but
	  just count and duration.
	- Fix issue with compressed csvlog. Thanks to Philip Freeman for the
	  report.
	- Allow usage of log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to
	  just collect statistics about the number of queries and their time.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Fix issue on syslog format and autodetect with additional info like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. Thanks to kapsalar for the report.
	- Removed unrecognized log line generated by deadlock_timeout.
	- Add missing information about unsupported csv log input from stdin.
	  It must be read from a file. Thank to Philip Freeman for the report.
	- Fix issue #28: Illegal division by zero with log file without query
	  and txt output. Thanks to rlowe for the report.
	- Update documentation about the -N | --appname option.
	- Rename --name option into --appname. Thanks to Guillaume Lellarge for
	  the patch.
	- Fix min/max value in xasis that was always represented 2 days by
	  default. Thanks to Casey Allen Shobe for the report.
	- Fix major bug when running pgbadger with the -e option. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the report and the great help
	- Change project url to http://dalibo.github.com/pgbadger/. Thanks to
	  Damien Clochard for this new hosting.
	- Fix lot of issues in CSV parser and force locale to be C. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the reports.
	- Improve speed with custom log_line_prefix.
	- Merge pull request #26 from elementalvoid/helpdoc-fix
	- Fixed help text for --exclude-file. Old help text indicated that the
	  option name was --exclude_file which was incorrect.
	- Remove the obsolete --regex-user and --regex-db options that was used
	  to specify a search pattern in the log_line_prefix to find the user
	  and db name. This is replaced by the --prefix option.
	- Replace Time column report header by Hour.
	- Fix another issue in log_line_prefix parser with stderr format
	- Add a more complex example using log_line_prefix
	- Fix log_line_prefix issue when using timepstamp with millisecond.
	- Add support to use any custom log_line_prefix with new option -p or
	  --prefix. See README for an example.
	- Fix false autodetection of CSV format when log_statement is enable or
	  in possible other cases. This was resulting in error: "FATAL: cannot
	  use CSV". Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix display of empty graph of connections per seconds
	- Allow character : in log line prefix, it will no more break the log
	  parsing. Thanks to John Rouillard for the report.
	- Add report of configuration parameter changes into the errors report
	  and change errors report by events report to handle important messages
	  that are not errors.
	- Allow pgbadger to recognize " autovacuum launcher" messages.

2012-08-21 - version 2.0

This major version adds some changes not backward compatible with previous
versions. Options -p and -g are not more used as progress bar and graphs
generation are enabled by default now.

The obsolete -l option use to specify the log file to parse has been reused to
specify an incremental file. Outside these changes and some bug fix there's
also new features:

    * Using an incremental file with -l option allow to parse multiple time a
      single log file and to "seek" at the last line parsed during the previous
      run. Useful if you have a log rotation not sync with your pgbadger run.
      For exemple you can run somthing like this:

	pgbadger `find /var/log/postgresql/ -name "postgresql*" -mtime -7 -type f` \
	    -o report_`date +%F`.html -l /var/run/pgbadger/last_run.log

    * All queries diplayed in the HTML report are now clickable to display or
      hide a nice SQL query format. This is called SQL format beautifier.

    * CSV log parser have been entirely rewritten to handle csv with multiline.

Every one should upgrade.

	  concerned queries.
	- Fix miss handling of multi lines queries on syslog.
	- Add -a|--average option to configure the per minutes average interval
	  for queries and connexions. If you want the average to be calculated

	  default --average 5. If you want average per hour set it to 60.
	- Add hourly statistics of connections and sessions as well as a chart
	  about the number of connection per second (5 minutes average).

    New feature:

	- Add graph of ckeckpoint Wal files usage (added, removed, recycled).
	- Add --image-format to allow the change of the default png image
	  format to jpeg.

	  Default filename is out.html or out.txt following the output format.
	  To dump to stdout set filename to -
