<blockquote>
<h3>Version 3.1 - Feb 21, 2013</h3>
<p>
This is a quick release to fix missing reports of most frequent errors and slowest
normalized queries in previous version published yesterday.
</p>
<pre>
        - Fix empty report in watchlog mode (-w option).
        - Force immediat die on command line options error.
        - Fix missing report of most frequent events/errors report. Thanks to
          Vincent Laborie for the report.
        - Fix missing report of slowest normalized queries.  Thanks to Vincent
          Laborie for the report.
        - Fix display of last print of progress bar when quiet mode is enabled.
</pre>

<h3>Version 3.0 - Feb 20, 2013</h3>
<p>
This new major release adds parallel log processing by using as many cores as wanted, the performances gain is directly related to the number of cores specified. There's also new reports about autovacuum/autoanalyze and many bugs have been fixed. No more needs to enable log_duration or log_min_duration log format all is handle in the same report at a time.
</p>
<pre>
	- Update documentation about log_duration, log_min_duration_statement
	  and log_statement.
	- Rewrite dirty code around log timestamp comparison to find timestamp
	  of the specified begin or ending date.
	- Remove distinction between logs with duration enabled from variables
	  log_min_duration_statement and log_duration. Commands line options
	  --enable-log_duration and --enable-log_min_duration have been removed.
	- Update documentation about parallel processing.
	- Remove usage of Storable::file_magic to autodetect binary format file,
	  it is not include in core perl 5.8. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the report.
	- Force multiprocess per file when files are compressed. Thanks to
	  Julien Rouhaud for the report.
	- Add progress bar for multiprocess by forking a dedicated process
	  and using pipe. Also fix some bugs in using binary format that
	  duplicate query/error samples per process.
	- chmod 755 pgbadger
	- Fix checkpoint reports when there is no checkpoint warnings.
	- Fix non report of hourly connections/checkpoint/autovacuum when not
	  query is found in log file. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Add -J|--job_per_file command line option to force pgbadger to use
	  one process per file instead of using all to parse one file. Useful
	  to have better performances with lot of small log file.
	- Fix parsing of orphan lines with stderr logs and log_line_prefix
	  without session information into the prefix (%l).
	- Update documentation about -j | --jobs option.
	- Allow pgbadger to use several cores, aka multiprocessing. Add options
	  -j | --jobs option to specify the number of core to use.
	- Add autovacuum and autoanalyze infos to binary format.
	- Fix case in SQL code highlighting where QQCODE temp keyword was not
	  replaced. Thanks to Julien Ruhaud for the report.
	- Add pie graph to show repartition of number of autovacuum per table
	  and number of tuples removed by autovacuum per table.
	- Add report of tuples/pages removed in report of Vacuums by table.
	- Fix major bug on syslog parser where years part of the date was
	  wrongly extracted from current date with logs generated in 2012.
	- Fix issue with Perl 5.16 that do not allow "ss" inside look-behind
	  assertions. Thanks to Cedric for the report.
	- New vacuum and analyze hourly reports and graphs. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the patch.
</pre>
<p>
UPGRADE: if you are running pgbadger by cron take care if you were using one of
the following option: --enable-log_min_duration  and --enable-log_duration, they
have been removed and pgbadger will refuse to start.
</p>

<h3>Version 2.3 - Jan 17, 2013</h3>
<p>
This release fixes several major issues especially with csvlog and a memory leak
with log parsing using a start date. There's also several improvement like new
reports of number of queries by database and application. Mouse over reported
queries will show database, user, remote client and application name where they
are executed.
</p>
<p>
A new binary input/output format have been introduced to allow saving or reading
precomputed statistics. This will allow incremental reports based on periodical
runs of pgbader. This is a work in progress fully available with next coming
major release.
</p>
<p>
Several SQL code beautifier improvement from pgFormatter have also been merged.
</p>
<pre>

	- Clarify misleading statement about log_duration: log_duration may be
	  turned on depending on desired information. Only log_statement must
	  not be on. Thanks to Matt Romaine for the patch.
	- Fix --dbname and --dbuser not working with csvlog format. Thanks to
	  Luke Cyca for the report.
	- Fix issue in SQL formatting that prevent left back indentation when
	  major keywords were found. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for the report.
	- Display 3 decimals in time report so that ms can be seen. Thanks to
	  Adam Schroder for the request.
	- Force the parser to not insert a new line after the SET keyword when
	  the query begin with it. This is to preserve the single line with
	  queries like SET client_encoding TO "utf8";
	- Add better SQL formatting of update queries by adding a new line
	  after the SET keyword. Thanks to pilat66 for the report.
	- Update copyright and documentation.
	- Queries without application name are now stored under others
	  application name.
	- Add report of number of queries by application if %a is specified in
	  the log_line_prefix.
	- Add link menu to the request per database and limit the display of
	  this information when there is more than one database.
	- Add report of requests per database.
	- Add report of user,remote client and application name to all request
	  info.
	- Fix memory leak with option -b (--begin) and in incremental log
	  parsing mode.
	- Remove duration part from log format auto-detection. Thanks to
	  Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix a performance issue on prettifying SQL queries that makes pgBagder
	  several time slower that usual to generate the HTML output. Thanks to
	  Vincent Laborie for the report.
	- Add missing SQL::Beautify paternity.
	- Add 'binary' format as input/output format. The binary output format
	  allows to save log statistics in a non human readable file instead of
	  an HTML or text file. These binary files might then be used as regular
	  input files, combined or not, to produce a html or txt report. Thanks
	  to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Remove port from the session regex pattern to match all lines.
	- Fix the progress bar. It was trying to use gunzip to get real file
	  size for all formats (by default). Unbreak the bz2 format (that does
	  not report real size) and add support for zip format. Thanks to Euler
	  Taveira de Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Fix some typos and grammatical issues. Thanks to Euler Taveira de
	  Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Improve SQL code highlighting and keywords detection merging change
	  from pgFormatter project.
	- Add support to hostname or ip address in the client detection. Thanks
	  to stuntmunkee for the report.

	- Allow usage of a dash into database, user and application names when
	  prefix is used. Thanks to Vipul for the report.
	- Mouse over queries will now show in which database they are executed
	  in the overviews (Slowest queries, Most frequent queries, etc. ).
	  Thank to Dirk-Jan Bulsink for the feature request.
	- Fix missing keys on %cur_info hash. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Move opening file handle to log file into a dedicated function.
	  Thanks to Marc Cousin for the patch.
	- Replace Ctrl+M by printable \r. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the report.
</pre>

<h3>Version 2.2 - Nov 13, 2012</h3>
<p>
This release add some major features like tsung output, speed improvement with
csvlog, report of shut down events, new command line options to generate report
excluding some user(s), to build report based on select queries only, to specify
regex of the queries that must only be included in the report and to remove
comments from queries. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade.
</p>
<pre>
	- Update PostgreSQL keywords list for 9.2
	- Fix number of queries in progress bar with tsung output.
	- Remove obsolete syslog-ng and temporary syslog-ll log format added to
	  fix some syslog autodetection issues. There is now just one syslog
	  format: syslog, differences between syslog formats are detected and
	  the log parser is adaptive.
	- Add comment about the check_incremental_position() method
	- Fix reports with empty graphs when log files were not in chronological
	  order.
	- Add report of current total of queries and events parsed in progress
	  bar. Thanks to Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Force pgBadger to use an require the XS version of Text::CSV instead
	  of the Pure Perl implementation. It is a good bit faster thanks to
	  David Fetter for the patch. Note that using csvlog is still a bit
	  slower than syslog or stderr log format.
	- Fix several issue with tsung output.
	- Add report of shut down events
	- Add debug information on command line used to pipe compressed log
	  file when -v is provide.
	- Add -U | --exclude-user command line option to generate report
	  excluded user. Thanks to Birta Levente for the feature request.
	- Allow some options to be specified multiple time or be written as a
	  coma separated list of value, here are these options: --dbname,
	  --dbuser, --dbclient, --dbappname, --exclude_user.

	  that must only be included in the report. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the feature request.
	- Fix auto detection of log_duration and log_min_duration_statement
	  format.
	- Fix parser issue with Windows logs without timezone information.
	  Thanks to Nicolas Thauvin for the report.
	- Fix bug in %r = remote host and port log line prefix detection.
	  Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski for the report.
	- Add -C | --nocomment option to remove comment like /* ... */ from
	  queries. Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski for the feature request.
	- Fix escaping of log_line_prefix. Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski
	  for the patch.
	- Fix wrong detection of update queries when a query has a object names
	  containing update and set. Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.
</pre>

<h3>Version 2.1 - Oct 12, 2012</h3>
<p>
This release adds a major feature by allowing any custom log_line_prefix to be
used with pgBadger. An other feature is the support to log_duration instead
of log_min_duration_statement to allow reports simply based on duration and
queries count without queries detail. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade asap.
pgBadger will also fully support compressed files with gzip, bzip2 and zip
utilities.
</p>
<pre>
	- Add new --enable-log_min_duration option to force pgbadger to use lines
	  generated by the log_min_duration_statement even if the log_duration
	  format is autodetected. Useful if you use both but do not log all queries.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Add syslog-ng format to better handle syslog traces with notation like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. It is autodetected but can be forced in the -f option
	  with value set to: syslog-ng.
	- Add --enable-log_duration command line option to force pgbadger to only
	  use the log_duration trace even if log_min_duration_statement traces are
	  autodetected.
	- Fix display of empty hourly graph when no data were found.
	- Remove query type report when log_duration is enabled.
	- Fix a major bug in query with bind parameter. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the report.
	- Fix detection of compressed log files and allow automatic detection
	  and uncompress of .gz, .bz2 and .zip files.
	- Add gunzip -l command to find the real size of a gzip compressed file.
	- Fix log_duration only reports to not take care about query detail but
	  just count and duration.
	- Fix issue with compressed csvlog. Thanks to Philip Freeman for the
	  report.
	- Allow usage of log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to
	  just collect statistics about the number of queries and their time.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Fix issue on syslog format and autodetect with additional info like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. Thanks to kapsalar for the report.
	- Removed unrecognized log line generated by deadlock_timeout.
	- Add missing information about unsupported csv log input from stdin.
	  It must be read from a file. Thank to Philip Freeman for the report.
	- Fix issue #28: Illegal division by zero with log file without query
	  and txt output. Thanks to rlowe for the report.
	- Update documentation about the -N | --appname option.
	- Rename --name option into --appname. Thanks to Guillaume Lellarge for
	  the patch.
	- Fix min/max value in xasis that was always represented 2 days by
	  default. Thanks to Casey Allen Shobe for the report.
	- Fix major bug when running pgbadger with the -e option. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the report and the great help
	- Change project url to http://dalibo.github.com/pgbadger/. Thanks to
	  Damien Clochard for this new hosting.
	- Fix lot of issues in CSV parser and force locale to be C. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the reports.
	- Improve speed with custom log_line_prefix.
	- Merge pull request #26 from elementalvoid/helpdoc-fix
	- Fixed help text for --exclude-file. Old help text indicated that the
	  option name was --exclude_file which was incorrect.
	- Remove the obsolete --regex-user and --regex-db options that was used
	  to specify a search pattern in the log_line_prefix to find the user
	  and db name. This is replaced by the --prefix option.
	- Replace Time column report header by Hour.
	- Fix another issue in log_line_prefix parser with stderr format
	- Add a more complex example using log_line_prefix
	- Fix log_line_prefix issue when using timepstamp with millisecond.
	- Add support to use any custom log_line_prefix with new option -p or
	  --prefix. See README for an example.
	- Fix false autodetection of CSV format when log_statement is enable or
	  in possible other cases. This was resulting in error: "FATAL: cannot
	  use CSV". Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix display of empty graph of connections per seconds
	- Allow character : in log line prefix, it will no more break the log
	  parsing. Thanks to John Rouillard for the report.
	- Add report of configuration parameter changes into the errors report
	  and change errors report by events report to handle important messages
	  that are not errors.
	- Allow pgbadger to recognize " autovacuum launcher" messages.
</pre>

<h3>Version 2.0 - Aug 21, 2012</h3>
<p>
This major version adds support for incremental runs to avoid computing statistics on old data and an SQL format beautifier on each reported query. The CSV log parser has been entirely rewritten.
</p>
<pre>
This major version adds some changes not backward compatible with previous versions. Options
-p and -g are not more used as progress bar and graphs generation are enabled by default now.
The obsolete -l option use to specify the log file to parse has been reused to specify an
incremental file. Outside these changes and some bug fix there's also new features:

    * Using an incremental file with -l option allow to parse multiple time a single log file
      and to "seek" at the last line parsed during the previous run. Useful if you have a log
      rotation not sync with your pgbadger run. For exemple you can run somthing like this:

        pgbadger `find /var/log/postgresql/ -name "postgresql*" -mtime -7 -type f` \
            -o report_`date +%F`.html -l /var/run/pgbadger/last_run.log

    * All queries displayed in the HTML report are now clickable to display or hide a nice 
      SQL query format. This is called SQL format beautifier.

    * CSV log parser have been entirely rewritten to handle csv with multiline.

Every one should upgrade.
