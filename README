ABSTRACT
    pgBadger - a fast PostgreSQL log analysis report

SYNOPSIS
    pgbadger [options] logfile [...]

            PostgreSQL log analyzer with fully detailed reports and charts.

    Arguments:

        logfile can be a single log file, a list of files, or a shell command
        returning a list of file. If you want to pass log content from stdin
        use - as filename. Note that input from stdin will not work with csvlog.

    Options:

        -a | --average minutes : number of minutes to build the average graphs of
                                 queries and connections.
        -b | --begin datetime  : start date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
        -d | --dbname database : only report what concern the given database
        -e | --end datetime    : end date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
        -f | --format logtype  : possible values: syslog,stderr,csv. Default: stderr
        -G | --nograph         : disable graphs on HTML output. Enable by default.
        -h | --help            : show this message and exit.
        -i | --ident name      : programname used as syslog ident. Default: postgres
        -l | --last-parsed file: allow incremental log parsing by registering the
                                 last datetime and line parsed. Useful if you want
                                 to watch errors since last run or if you want one
                                 report per day with a log rotated each week.
        -m | --maxlength size  : maximum length of a query, it will be cutted above
                                 the given size. Default: no truncate
        -n | --nohighlight     : disable SQL code highlighting.
        -N | --appname name    : only report what concern the given application name

                                 of the output format: out.html or out.txt. To dump
                                 output to stdout use - as filename.
        -p | --prefix string   : give here the value of your custom log_line_prefix
                                 defined in your postgresql.conf. You may used it only
                                 if don't have the default allowed formats ot to use
                                 other custom variables like client ip or application
                                 name. See examples below.
        -P | --no-prettify     : disable SQL queries prettify formatter.
        -q | --quiet           : don't print anything to stdout, even not a progress bar.

                                 zcat is not on your path or you want to use gzcat.
        --pie-limit num        : pie data lower than num% will show a sum instead.
        --exclude-query regex  : any query matching the given regex will be excluded
                                 from the report. For example: "^(VACUUM|COMMIT)"
                                 you can use this option multiple time.
        --exclude-file filename: path of the file which contains all the regex to use
                                 to exclude queries from the report. One regex per line.

    Examples:

            pgbadger /var/log/postgresql.log
            pgbadger /var/log/postgres.log.2.gz /var/log/postgres.log.1.gz /var/log/postgres.log
            pgbadger /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-2012-05-*
            pgbadger --exclude-query="^(COPY|COMMIT)" /var/log/postgresql.log
            pgbadger -b "2012-06-25 10:56:11" -e "2012-06-25 10:59:11" /var/log/postgresql.log
            cat /var/log/postgres.log | pgbadger -
            # log prefix with stderr log output
            perl pgbadger --prefix '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d,client=%h' \
                            /pglog/postgresql-2012-08-21*
            perl pgbadger --prefix '%m %u@%d %p %r %a : ' /pglog/postgresql.log
            # Log line prefix with syslog log output
            perl pgbadger --prefix 'user=%u,db=%d,client=%h,appname=%a' \
                            /pglog/postgresql-2012-08-21*

    Reporting errors every week by cron job:

        30 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q -w /var/log/postgresql.log -o /var/reports/pg_errors.html

    Generate report every week using incremental behavior:

        0 4 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q `find /var/log/ -mtime -7 -name "postgresql.log*"` \
            -o /var/reports/pg_errors-`date +%F`.html -l /var/reports/pgbadger_incremental_file.dat

    This suppose that your log file and HTML report are also rotated every
    week.

DESCRIPTION
    pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer built for speed with fully
    detailed reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small
    Perl script that aims to replace and outperform the old php script
    pgFouine.

    By the way, we would like to thank Guillaume Smet for all the work he
    has done on this really nice tool. We've been using it a long time, it
    is a really great tool!

    pgBadger is written in pure Perl language. It uses a javascript library
    to draw graphs so that you don't need additional Perl modules or any
    other package to install. Furthermore, this library gives us additional
    features, such as zooming.

    pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr or
    csvlog). It is designed to parse huge log files, as well as gzip
    compressed file. See a complete list of features below.

FEATURE
    pgBadger reports everything about your SQL queries:

            Overall statistics.
            The slowest queries.
            Queries that took up the most time.
            The most frequent queries.
            The most frequent errors.

    The following reports are also available with hourly charts:

            Hourly queries statistics.
            Hourly temporary file statistics.
            Hourly checkpoints statistics.
            Locks statistics.
            Queries by type (select/insert/update/delete).
            Sessions per database/user/client.
            Connections per database/user/client.

    All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images. SQL queries
    reported are highlighted and beautified automatically.

REQUIREMENT
    PgBadger comes as a single Perl script- you do not need anything else
    than a modern Perl distribution. Charts are rendered using a Javascript
    library so you don't need anything. Your browser will do all the work.

    If you planned to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files you might need some
    Perl Modules:

            Text::CSV - to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files.

    This module is optional, if you don't have PostgreSQL log in the CSV
    format you don't need to install it.

    Under Windows OS you may not be able to use gzipped log files unless you
    have a zcat like utility that could uncompress the log file and send
    content to stdout. If you have such an utility or in other OSes you want
    to use other compression utility like bzip2 or Zip, use the --zcat
    comand line option as follow:

            --zcat="unzip -p" or --zcat="gunzip -c" or --zcat="bzip2 -dc"

    the last example can also be used like this: --zcat="bzcat"

POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION
    You must enable some configuration directives in your postgresql.conf
    before starting.

    You must first enable SQL query logging to have something to parse:

            log_min_duration_statement = 0

    Note that pgBadger is not compatible with statements logs provided by
    log_statement and log_duration.

    With 'stderr' log format, log_line_prefix must be at least:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] '

    Log line prefix could add user and database name as follows:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d '

    or for syslog log file format:

            log_line_prefix = 'user=%u,db=%d '

    Log line prefix for stderr output could also be:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] db=%d,user=%u '

    or for syslog output:

            log_line_prefix = 'db=%d,user=%u '

    You need to enable other parameters in postgresql.conf to get more
    informations from your log files:

            log_checkpoints = on
            log_connections = on
            log_disconnections = on
            log_lock_waits = on
            log_temp_files = 0

    Do not enable log_statement and log_duration, their log format will not
    be parsed by pgBadger.

    Of course your log messages should be in english without locale support:

            lc_messages='C'

    but this is not only recommanded by pgbadger.

INSTALLATION
    Download the tarball from github and unpack the archive as follow:

            tar xzf pgbadger-1.x.tar.gz
            cd pgbadger-1.x/
            perl Makefile.PL
            make && sudo make install

    This will copy the Perl script pgbadger in /usr/local/bin/pgbadger
    directory by default and the man page into
    /usr/local/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1. Those are the default installation
    directory for 'site' install.

    If you want to install all under /usr/ location, use INSTALLDIRS='perl'
    as argument of Makefile.PL. The script will be installed into
    /usr/bin/pgbadger and the manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1.

    For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as
    follow:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

    By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.
