NAME
    pgBadger - a fast PostgreSQL log analysis report

SYNOPSIS
    pgbadger [options] logfile [...]

            PostgreSQL log analyzer with fully detailed reports and charts.

    Arguments:

        logfile can be a single log file, a list of files, or a shell command
        returning a list of files. If you want to pass log content from stdin
        use - as filename. Note that input from stdin will not work with csvlog.

    Options:

        -a | --average minutes : number of minutes to build the average graphs of
                                 queries and connections. Default 5 minutes.
        -A | --histo-avg minutes: number of minutes to build the histogram graphs
                                 of queries. Default 60 minutes.
        -b | --begin datetime  : start date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
        -c | --dbclient host   : only report on entries for the given client host.

        -l | --last-parsed file: allow incremental log parsing by registering the
                                 last datetime and line parsed. Useful if you want
                                 to watch errors since last run or if you want one
                                 report per day with a log rotated each week.
        -m | --maxlength size  : maximum length of a query, it will be restricted to

        --ssh-timeout second     timeout to ssh connection failure. Default 10 seconds.
        --ssh-options  options   list of -o options to use for the ssh connection. Options
                                 always used:
                                     -o ConnectTimeout=$ssh_timeout
                                     -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey

    Examples:

            pgbadger /var/log/postgresql.log
            pgbadger /var/log/postgres.log.2.gz /var/log/postgres.log.1.gz /var/log/postgres.log
            pgbadger /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-2012-05-*
            pgbadger --exclude-query="^(COPY|COMMIT)" /var/log/postgresql.log
            pgbadger -b "2012-06-25 10:56:11" -e "2012-06-25 10:59:11" /var/log/postgresql.log
            cat /var/log/postgres.log | pgbadger -
            # log prefix with stderr log output
            perl pgbadger --prefix '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d,client=%h' \
                            /pglog/postgresql-2012-08-21*
            perl pgbadger --prefix '%m %u@%d %p %r %a : ' /pglog/postgresql.log
            # Log line prefix with syslog log output
            perl pgbadger --prefix 'user=%u,db=%d,client=%h,appname=%a' \
                            /pglog/postgresql-2012-08-21*

    Use my 8 CPUs to parse my 10GB file faster, really faster

            perl pgbadger -j 8 /pglog/postgresql-9.1-main.log

    Generate Tsung sessions XML file with select queries only:

        perl pgbadger -S -o sessions.tsung --prefix '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d ' /pglog/postgresql-9.1.log

    Reporting errors every week by cron job:

        30 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q -w /var/log/postgresql.log -o /var/reports/pg_errors.html

    Generate report every week using incremental behavior:

        0 4 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q `find /var/log/ -mtime -7 -name "postgresql.log*"` \
            -o /var/reports/pg_errors-`date +%F`.html -l /var/reports/pgbadger_incremental_file.dat

    This supposes that your log file and HTML report are also rotated every
    week.

    Or better, use the auto-generated incremental reports:

        0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 \
            -O /var/www/pg_reports/

    will generate a report per day and per week in the given output
    directory.

    If you have a pg_dump at 23:00 and 13:00 each day during half an hour,
    you can use pgbadger as follow to exclude these periods from the report:

        pgbadger --exclude-time "2013-09-.* (23|13):.*" postgresql.log

    This will help to not have all COPY order on top of slowest queries. You
    can also use --exclude-appname "pg_dump" to solve this problem in a more
    simple way.

DESCRIPTION
    pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer build for speed with fully
    detailed reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small
    Perl script that outperform any other PostgreSQL log analyzer.

    It is written in pure Perl language and uses a javascript library
    (flotr2) to draw graphs so that you don't need to install any additional
    Perl modules or other packages. Furthermore, this library gives us more
    features such as zooming. pgBadger also uses the Bootstrap javascript
    library and the FontAwesome webfont for better design. Everything is
    embedded.

    pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr or
    csvlog). It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip
    compressed file. See a complete list of features below. Supported
    compressed format are gzip, bzip2 and xz. For the last one you must have
    a xz version upper than 5.05 that support the --robot option.

    All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images.

    You can also limit pgBadger to only report errors or remove any part of
    the report using command line options.

    pgBadger supports any custom format set into log_line_prefix of your
    postgresql.conf file provide that you use the %t, %p and %l patterns.

    pgBadger allow parallel processing on a single log file and multiple
    files through the use of the -j option and the number of CPUs as value.

    If you want to save system performance you can also use log_duration
    instead of log_min_duration_statement to have reports on duration and
    number of queries only.

FEATURE
    pgBadger reports everything about your SQL queries:

            Overall statistics
            The most frequent waiting queries.
            Queries that waited the most.
            Queries generating the most temporary files.
            Queries generating the largest temporary files.
            The slowest queries.
            Queries that took up the most time.
            The most frequent queries.
            The most frequent errors.
            Histogram of query times.

    The following reports are also available with hourly charts divide by
    periods of five minutes:

            SQL queries statistics.
            Temporary file statistics.
            Checkpoints statistics.
            Autovacuum and autoanalyze statistics.

    There's also some pie reports of distribution about:

            Locks statistics.
            ueries by type (select/insert/update/delete).
            Distribution of queries type per database/application
            Sessions per database/user/client.
            Connections per database/user/client.
            Autovacuum and autoanalyze per table.

    All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images. SQL queries
    reported are highlighted and beautified automatically.

    You can also have incremental reports with one report per day and a
    cumulative report per week. Two multiprocess modes are available to
    speed up log parsing, one using one core per log file, and the second to
    use multiple core to parse a single file. Both modes can be combined.

    Histogram granularity can be adjusted using the -A command line option.
    By default they will report the mean of each top queries/error occuring
    per hour, but you can specify the granularity down to the minute.

    pgBadger can also be used in a central place to parse remote log files
    using a password less SSH connection. This mode can be used with
    compressed files and in mode multiprocess per file (-J) but can not be
    used with CSV log format.

REQUIREMENT
    pgBadger comes as a single Perl script - you do not need anything other
    than a modern Perl distribution. Charts are rendered using a Javascript
    library so you don't need anything. Your browser will do all the work.

    If you planned to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files you might need some
    Perl Modules:

            Text::CSV_XS - to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files.

    This module is optional, if you don't have PostgreSQL log in the CSV
    format you don't need to install it.

    Also if you planned to save output in JSON format you need install
    Perl module JSON::XS first, this module is optional.

    Compressed log file format is autodetected from the file exension. If
    pgBadger find a gz extension it will use the zcat utility, with a bz2
    extension it will use bzcat and if the file extension is zip or xz then
    the unzip or xz utilities will be used.

    If those utilities are not found in the PATH environment variable then
    use the --zcat command line option to change this path. For example:

            --zcat="/usr/local/bin/gunzip -c" or --zcat="/usr/local/bin/bzip2 -dc"
            --zcat="C:\tools\unzip -p"

    By default pgBadger will use the zcat, bzcat and unzip utilities
    following the file extension. If you use the default autodetection
    compress format you can mixed gz, bz2, xz or zip files. Specifying a
    custom value to --zcat option will remove this feature of mixed
    compressed format.

    Note that multiprocessing can not be used with compressed files or CSV
    files as well as under Windows platform.

INSTALLATION
    Download the tarball from github and unpack the archive as follow:

            tar xzf pgbadger-4.x.tar.gz
            cd pgbadger-4.x/
            perl Makefile.PL
            make && sudo make install

    This will copy the Perl script pgbadger to /usr/local/bin/pgbadger by
    default and the man page into /usr/local/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1.
    Those are the default installation directories for 'site' install.

    If you want to install all under /usr/ location, use INSTALLDIRS='perl'
    as an argument of Makefile.PL. The script will be installed into
    /usr/bin/pgbadger and the manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1.

    For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as
    follows:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

    By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.

POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION
    You must enable and set some configuration directives in your
    postgresql.conf before starting.

    You must first enable SQL query logging to have something to parse:

            log_min_duration_statement = 0

    Here every statement will be logged, on busy server you may want to
    increase this value to only log queries with a higher duration time.
    Note that if you have log_statement set to 'all' nothing will be logged
    through log_min_duration_statement. See next chapter for more
    information.

    With 'stderr' log format, log_line_prefix must be at least:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] '

    Log line prefix could add user and database name as follows:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d '

    or for syslog log file format:

            log_line_prefix = 'user=%u,db=%d '

    Log line prefix for stderr output could also be:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] db=%d,user=%u '

    or for syslog output:

            log_line_prefix = 'db=%d,user=%u '

    You need to enable other parameters in postgresql.conf to get more
    information from your log files:

            log_checkpoints = on
            log_connections = on
            log_disconnections = on
            log_lock_waits = on
            log_temp_files = 0
            log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0

    Do not enable log_statement as their log format will not be parsed by
    pgBadger.

    Of course your log messages should be in English without locale support:

            lc_messages='C'

    but this is not only recommended by pgBadger.

log_min_duration_statement, log_duration and log_statement
    If you want full statistics reports you must set
    log_min_duration_statement to 0 or more milliseconds.

    If you just want to report duration and number of queries and don't want
    all details about queries, set log_min_duration_statement to -1 to
    disable it and enable log_duration in your postgresql.conf file. If you
    want to add the most common request report you can either choose to set
    log_min_duration_statement to a higher value or choose to enable
    log_statement.

    Enabling log_min_duration_statement will add reports about slowest
    queries and queries that took up the most time. Take care that if you
    have log_statement set to 'all' nothing will be logged with
    log_line_prefix.

PARALLEL PROCESSING
    To enable parallel processing you just have to use the -j N option where
    N is the number of cores you want to use.

    pgbadger will then proceed as follow:

            for each log file
                chunk size = int(file size / N)
                look at start/end offsets of these chunks
                fork N processes and seek to the start offset of each chunk
                    each process will terminate when the parser reach the end offset
                    of its chunk
                    each process write stats into a binary temporary file
               wait for all children has terminated
            All binary temporary files generated will then be read and loaded into
            memory to build the html output.

    With that method, at start/end of chunks pgbadger may truncate or omit a
    maximum of N queries perl log file which is an insignificant gap if you
    have millions of queries in your log file. The chance that the query
    that you were looking for is loose is near 0, this is why I think this
    gap is livable. Most of the time the query is counted twice but
    truncated.

    When you have lot of small log files and lot of CPUs it is speedier to
    dedicate one core to one log file at a time. To enable this behavior you
    have to use option -J N instead. With 200 log files of 10MB each the use
    of the -J option start being really interesting with 8 Cores. Using this
    method you will be sure to not loose any queries in the reports.

    He are a benchmarck done on a server with 8 CPUs and a single file of
    9.5GB.

             Option |  1 CPU  | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
            --------+---------+-------+-------+------
               -j   | 1h41m18 | 50m25 | 25m39 | 15m58
               -J   | 1h41m18 | 54m28 | 41m16 | 34m45

    With 200 log files of 10MB each and a total og 2GB the results are
    slightly different:

             Option | 1 CPU | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
            --------+-------+-------+-------+------
               -j   | 20m15 |  9m56 |  5m20 | 4m20
               -J   | 20m15 |  9m49 |  5m00 | 2m40

    So it is recommanded to use -j unless you have hundred of small log file
    and can use at least 8 CPUs.

    IMPORTANT: when you are using parallel parsing pgbadger will generate a
    lot of temporary files in the /tmp directory and will remove them at
    end, so do not remove those files unless pgbadger is not running. They
    are all named with the following template tmp_pgbadgerXXXX.bin so they
    can be easily identified.

INCREMENTAL REPORTS
    pgBadger include an automatic incremental report mode using option -I or
    --incremental. When running in this mode, pgBadger will generate one
    report per day and a cumulative report per week. Output is first done in
    binary format into the mandatory output directory (see option -O or
    --outdir), then in HTML format for daily and weekly reports with a main
    index file.

    The main index file will show a dropdown menu per week with a link to
    the week report and links to daily reports of this week.

    For example, if you run pgBadger as follow based on a daily rotated
    file:

        0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 \
            -O /var/www/pg_reports/

    you will have all daily and weekly reports for the full running period.

    In this mode pgBagder will create an automatic incremental file into the
    output directory, so you don't have to use the -l option unless you want
    to change the path of that file. This mean that you can run pgBadger in
    this mode each days on a log file rotated each week, it will not count
    the log entries twice.

BINARY FORMAT
    Using the binary format it is possible to create custom incremental and
    cumulative reports. For example, if you want to refresh a pgbadger
    report each hour from a daily PostgreSQl log file, you can proceed by
    running each hour the following commands:

        pgbadder --last-parsed .pgbadger_last_state_file -o sunday/hourX.bin /var/log/pgsql/postgresql-Sun.log

    to generate the incremental data files in binary format. And to generate
    the fresh HTML report from that binary file:

        pgbadder sunday/*.bin

    Or an other example, if you have one log file per hour and you want a
    reports to be rebuild each time the log file is switched. Proceed as
    follow:

            pgbadger -o day1/hour01.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_10.log
            pgbadger -o day1/hour02.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_11.log
            pgbadger -o day1/hour03.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_12.log
            ...

    When you want to refresh the HTML report, for example each time after a
    new binary file is generated, just do the following:

            pgbadger -o day1_report.html day1/*.bin

    Adjust the commands following your needs.
