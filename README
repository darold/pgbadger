ABSTRACT
    pgBadger - a fast PostgreSQL log analysis report

SYNOPSIS
    pgbadger [options] logfile [...]

            PostgreSQL log analyzer with fully detailed reports and charts.

    Arguments:

      logfile can be a single log file, a list of files or a shell command
      returning a list of file.

    Options:

        -l | --logfile filename: path to the PostgreSQL log file to parse. It can
                                 be a plain text log or a gzip compressed file
                                 with the .gz extension. Note that this option is
                                 DEPRECATED, set logfile as a command line argument
                                 instead.
        -f | --format logtype  : the value can be: syslog, stderr or csv. Default: stderr
        -o | --outfile filename: define the filename for the output. Default depends
                                 of the output format: out.html or out.txt. To dump
                                 output to stdout use - as filename.
        -i | --ident name      : programname used as syslog ident. Default: postgres
        -h | --help            : show this message and exit.
        -d | --dbname database : only report what concern the given database
        -u | --dbuser username : only report what concern the given user
        -t | --top number      : number of query to store/display. Default: 20
        -s | --sample number   : number of query sample to store/display. Default: 3
        -x | --extension       : output format. Values: text or html. Default: html
        -m | --maxlength size  : maximum length of a query, it will be cutted above
                                 the given size. Default: no truncate
        -g | --graph           : generate graphs with a javascript plotting library.
        -b | --begin datetime  : start date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
                                 Format: -b "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
        -e | --end datetime    : end date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
                                 Format: -e "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
        -q | --quiet           : disable output to stderr and don't print debug informations.
        -p | --progress        : show a progress bar, quiet mode is enabled with this option.
        -v | --version         : show current version
        --pie-limit num        : do not show pie data lower that num%, show a sum of them instead.
        -w | -watch-mode       : only report errors just like logwatch could do.
        --exclude-query regex  : any query matching the given regex will be excluded
                                 from the report. For example: "^(COPY|VACUUM|COMMIT)"
                                 you can use this option multiple time.
        --disable-error        : do not generate error report.
        --disable-hourly       : do not generate hourly reports.
        --disable-query        : do not generate queries reports (slowest, most frequent, ...).

    Examples:

            pgbadger -p -g /var/log/postgresql.log
            pgbadger -p -g /var/log/postgres.log.2.gz /var/log/postgres.log.1.gz /var/log/postgres.log
            pgbadger -p -g `ls /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-2012-05-*`
            pgbadger -p -g --exclude-query="^(COPY|VACUUM|COMMIT)" /var/log/postgresql.log

    Reporting errors every week by cron job:

        30 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q -w /var/log/postgresql.log -o /var/reports/pg_errors.html

    this suppose that your log file and HTML report are also rotated every
    weeks.

DESCRIPTION
    pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer build for speed with fully
    detailed reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small
    Perl script that aims to replace and outperform the old php script
    pgFouine.

    By the way, we would like to thank Guillaume Smet for all the work he
    has done on this really nice tool. We've been using it a long time, it
    was a really great tool!

    pgBadger is written in pure Perl language. It uses a javascript library
    to draw graphs so that you don't need additional Perl modules or any
    other package to install. Furthermore, this library gives us more
    features such as zooming.

    pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr or
    csvlog). It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip
    compressed file. See a complete list of features below.

FEATURE
    pgBadger reports everything about your SQL queries:

            Overall statistics.
            The slowest queries.
            Queries that took up the most time.
            The most frequent queries.
            The most frequent errors.

    The following reports are also available with hourly charts:

            Hourly queries statistics.
            Hourly temporary file statistics.
            Hourly checkpoints statistics.
            Locks statistics.
            Queries by type (select/insert/update/delete).
            Sessions per database/user/client.
            Connections per database/user/client.

    All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images.

REQUIREMENT
    PgBadger comes as a single Perl script, you do not need anything else
    than a modern Perl distribution. Charts are rendered using a Javascript
    library so you don't need anything, your browser will do all the work.

    If you planned to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files you might need some
    Perl Modules:

            Text::CSV - to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files.

    This module is optional, if you don't have PostgreSQL log in the CSV
    format you don't need to install it.

POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION
    You must enable some configuration directives into your postgresql.conf
    before starting.

    You must first enable SQL query logging to have something to parse:

            log_min_duration_statement = 0

    Note that pgBadger is not compatible with statements logs provided by
    log_statement and log_duration.

    With 'stderr' log format, log_line_prefix must be at least:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] '

    Log line prefix could add user and database name as follow:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d '

    or for syslog log file format:

            log_line_prefix = 'user=%u,db=%d '

    Log line prefix for stderr output could also be:

            log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] db=%d,user=%u '

    or for syslog output:

            log_line_prefix = 'db=%d,user=%u '

    You need to enable other parameters in postgresql.conf to get more
    informations from your log files:

            log_checkpoints = on
            log_connections = on
            log_disconnections = on
            log_lock_waits = on
            log_temp_files = 0

    Do not enable log_statement and log_duration, their log format will not
    be parsed by pgBadger.

INSTALLATION
    Download the tarball from github and unpack the archive as follow:

            tar xzf pgbadger-1.x.tar.gz
            cd pgbadger-1.x/
            perl Makefile.PL
            make && make install

    This will copy the Perl script pgbadger in /usr/local/bin/pgbadger
    directory by default and the man page into
    /usr/local/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1. Those are the default installation
    directory for 'site' install.

    If you want to install all under /usr/ location, use INSTALLDIRS='perl'
    as argument of Makefile.PL. The script will be installed into
    /usr/bin/pgbadger and the manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1.

    For example to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as
    follow:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

    By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.
